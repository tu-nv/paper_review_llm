The increase in duplicate NFTs in recent years brings the need for discovery tools for forged NFTs, some of which include using image hash functions. Though the problem of image duplication is widely discussed, detecting NFT duplications requires using fast detection methods as a new NFT image needs to be compared with the entire NFT history on the blockchain. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several image-hash functions, examine the cases where each function performs well, and evaluate multiple image-hash-functions-based NFT duplication detectors. Our models achieve more than 97.5% success in detecting NFT duplications and show that using several hash functions rather than one increases the ability to detect duplications.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nA non-fungible token (NFT) [1] is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content such as art [2], music [3], videos [4] and even event tickets [5]. NFTs are blockchain-based, using smart contract technologies supplied by blockchain systems such as Ethereum [6]. NFTs were first proposed in Ethereum Improvement Pro- posals (EIP)-721 [1], and were later implemented in EIP- 1155 [7]. NFTs differ from classical cryptocurrencies [8] such as Bitcoin [9] or Ether [6] as while in classical cryptocurrencies all tokens are fungible, or equal, and hence can be exchanged like-for-like, each NFT is unique, making it non-fungible. While NFTs have gained vast popularity in recent years, NFTs face many challenges and NFT abuse can be accessible and simple [5], [10]. Over 80% of the assets of OpenSea 1 , the world\u2019s first and largest Web3 marketplace for NFTs and crypto col- lectibles, that were flagged as plagiarized works, fake collections, and spam were created with their simplified \u201clazy minting\u201d [11]. As the number of NFTs created increases (NFT ex- changes recorded a trading volume of 343 billion USD in the second quarter of 2021 [12]), the issue of NFT duplica- tion arises. This both reduces the value and uniqueness of the original asset and leads to copyright infringement and legal disputes. As the digital content looks nearly identical and is at a lower cost, unsuspecting buyers might tend to favor duplications of the original items [13]. Das et al. [14] used a simple perceptual hashing algorithm, down- loaded around ten million NFT images from OpenSea and\n\n1 https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/8381389579539-What-is- OpenSea-s-copymint-policy-\n\ndiscovered almost 60 thousand hash collisions, manually verifying that most of the collisions they found were indeed visually identical images. Though image duplication detection is widely studied, most reverse image search studies use perceptual hashing or ML tools to extract features from images: [15] uses basic perceptual hash functions, [16] uses a CNN network to extract features from images and then use an LSH (Locality Sensitive Hash) hash function on the CNN output, and similarly, [17] use deep learning too for this task. These solutions have difficulties in achieving good performance, as a previous study [18] showed for example that Google\u2019s reverse image engine had a success rate of 42-71%, depending on the the image category. In this paper, we study the use of multiple image-hash- based functions for NFT image near-duplication detection. As OpenSea defines several criteria for image duplica- tions, we analyze how the hash functions perform on each duplication type. We show the different hash functions perform differently on each duplication type, and there is no single hash function that performs better than others in all cases. Then, we implement several image-hash- function-based NFT duplication classifiers, showing they can detect duplications successfully in 97 . 5% of the cases. Finally, we conclude our results and explore possible future work directions.\n\nII. BACKGROUND A. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital iden- tifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is used to certify ownership and authenticity. The NFT ownership can be transferred by its owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. NFTs typically contain references to digital files such as images, audio, and videos. In practice, the ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal restrictions as an NFT does not restrict the sharing or copying of its associated digital file. The notion of NFT was introduced in 2018 in a paper titled ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Standard by Entriken et al. [1] as a standard for smart contracts by which tokens are distinct and have unique attributes and ownership details. While NFT prices reached record highs in 2021-2 with artwork being sold for over 69 million USD, prices and trading volumes became significantly lower in 2023.\n\nB. Near Duplication Detection The field of image Near-Duplication Detection has been widely researched in the past 20 years [19], [20],\n\n[21], [22]. In recent years, with the increase of interest in machine learning, most recent researches focus on learning-based methods to detect image duplications [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. These techniques include studying unique image features to classify duplications correctly. Yet, applying these solutions to image NFT duplications is not trivial as this task requires the use of a very fast model. Near-duplicated content protection (visual fingerprint- ing) is a technology designed to detect slightly altered iterations of multimedia content. Through fingerprinting, the perceptual attributes of digital content are condensed into a semantically consistent digest. Unlike cryptographic hashing, which merely indicates whether two data pieces are precisely identical, fingerprinting preserves semantic details about the input. This enables not only the determi- nation of strict equality between two fingerprints but also the assessment of their degree of similarity [28]. While many near-duplication detection solutions are machine- learning-based and are heavy to process, other solutions that involve image hashing are much more lightweight. Recent work [29] has suggested using image hashing on NFT marketplaces to detect NFT duplications. Al- though this work focuses mainly on the marketplaces rather than duplication detection, it shows the potential of image hashing for NFT near duplication detection. More generally, a recent survey examines the applicability of hash-based data structures and aggregation methods like rollups in blockchain networks for anomaly detection and beyond [30], [31].\n\nC. NFTDuplication\n\nAlthough the border between copying an image and creating a new image based on an existing image is not exactly defined, OpenSea defines several characteristics for copyminting , that is an NFT image that is considered a duplication:\n\n\u2022 A pixel-for-pixel replica (exact match of an original collection).\n\n\u2022 A flipped, rotated, or facing the opposite direction replica.\n\n\u2022 A resized, zoomed in or out, cropped, or repositioned replica.\n\n\u2022 A replica with added or removed borders and edges.\n\n\u2022 A replica with unintegrated texts, logos, or emojis, either typed or drawn.\n\n\u2022 A replica that only swaps the background color.\n\n\u2022 A pixelated version of the original artwork.\n\n\u2022 A replica with colors swapped, modified, or satu- rated (for example, colors have been brightened or darkened, including black and white versions of the original).\n\nD. Image Hashing\n\nImage hashing refers to hash-based algorithms used to assign a unique hash value to an image. In this process, an image is converted into a fixed-size hash value, where, un- like standard cryptographic hashes, similar images should produce a similar hash. Image hashing is useful for tasks\n\nsuch as image compression, image similarity comparison, image retrieval, and near-duplicate detection. Some of the most common image hashing functions are average hashing ( aHash ), perceptual hashing ( pHash ), difference hashing ( dHash ), Haar Wavelet Hashing ( wHash ), and HSVColor Hashing ( HSVHash ). The main steps of an image hash algorithm are as follows: First, some prepro- cessing (such as grayscaling) is performed on the image. Feature extraction (such as color distributions and texture patterns) may optionally be performed too. Later, some normalization can be performed on the image and then the hash function (converting the input into some hash string) is applied. After a hash is created, it can be compared to another hash, usually using Hamming distance [32] (the number of positions at which the bits of the two hashes are different). In this paper, we evaluate and make use of the following image hash functions, creating a 64-bit hash (except HSVHash producing a 42-bit hash): (i) aHash [33] - The aHash algorithm first converts the input image to grayscale and then scales it down. As a 64-bit hash is generated, the image is scaled down to 8\u00d78 pixels. Next, the average of all gray values of the image is calculated, and the hash is generated: For each pixel, if a pixel is greater than the average, it is set to 1, otherwise, it is set to 0. (ii) pHash [34] - This algorithm is similar to aHash , just uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). After grayscaling, the DCT is calculated and it is reduced. Finally, each pixel is compared to some threshold and if it is greater than this value it is set to 1, otherwise, it is set to 0. (iii) dHash [35] - The difference hash algorithm works by computing the difference (i.e. relative gradients) be- tween adjacent pixels. After grayscaling and resizing, the difference is computed and a difference matrix is built. Based on the difference matrix D, the hash is created (if D[x] > D[x + 1] set 1 for bit x, else 0.). (iv) wHash [36] - The Wavelet hashing algorithm uses wavelet transformation. After grayscaling and resizing, the wavelet transformation is applied. Then, each pixel block is compared to the median of all gray values of the image and is set accordingly to 1 or 0. (v) HSVHash [37] - First, the image is converted to an HSV form. Then, the image is divided into blocks (or regions). For each block or region, a hash value is generated based on statistical measures of the HSV values, and the final hash is created from all block hashes. (vi) Image-Segmentation-Based hashing ( sHash ) [38] - This hashing algorithm meant to deal with cropped images. It relies on the assumption that even after cropping at least some large objects of an image will be left. Hence, this algorithm uses image segmentation to identify large objects of an image and for each object calculates one hash (using one of the previous hashing algorithms) of the bounding box. This way, rather than calculating one robust hash for an image, a set of robust hashes of the areas containing the largest objects of an image are calculated and stored individually. When comparing a new image to\n\n2\n\nthe original image hash, segment the image and calculate the hash of each segment. For each segment hash of the image, search for the hash of the original image segment with the lowest Hamming distance (meaning search for the most-alike segment of the original image) and compare the two hashes. All hash algorithms described above were implemented in Python and made publicly available in [39].\n\nIII. IMAGE HASHING EVALUATION\n\nAfter reviewing multiple image-hashing functions that can potentially be used for duplication detection, we were interested in evaluating what functions are valid for this task. Additionally, we wanted to see if the different hash functions perform differently on various image modifi- cations, meaning if there are modifications that some functions capture better than others, and whether there exists one function that is better than others in all cases. Section III-A describes the dataset used for the evaluation, followed by section III-B evaluating the performance of the hash functions presented in Section II-D.\n\nA. Dataset\n\nAs finding a reliable and labeled NFT duplication data set is not an easy task, and since we needed a label of not only whether the image is a duplication but also what type of duplication it is, we generated a database using Python\u2019s Pillow (PIL) [40] package. Following OpenSea\u2019s definition of copyminting, we implemented functions per- forming modifications on the original image (Fig. 1) of the following types:\n\n\u2022 Flipping, rotating and mirroring an image (Fig. 2).\n\n\u2022 Resizing, zooming, cropping, repositioning or modi- fying borders and edges (Fig. 3).\n\n\u2022 Addition of unintegrated texts, logos or emojis (Fig. 4).\n\n\u2022 Background-color change (Fig. 5).\n\n\u2022 Pixelating the image (Fig. 6).\n\n\u2022 Color swapping, modifying or saturating (Fig. 7). To generate a full data set, we downloaded ten im- ages of famous paintings and NFTs from OpenSea and generated 1000 duplications of each image, labeled into the previously presented criteria. Then, the data was split into two subsets where 80% of the data was used for the analysis of Section III-B evaluating the different image hash functions on the different duplication cases, and the remaining 20% of the data was used in Section IV-B for testing the different image duplication detectors present. We note that as the duplication image needs to look similar to the original one, we limited cropping to 50% and, added text or emojis to be smaller than 20% of the original image.\n\nB. Image Hash Evaluation\n\nAfter generating our dataset, we were set to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of image hash functions for NFT duplication detection. For each image, six hash values were calculated: aHash , pHash , dHash , wHash , HSVHash and sHash . Then, for each duplication criterion,\n\nwe calculated the average Hamming distance between each duplication image and its original image. We also evaluated the average Hamming distance between an orig- inal image and other non-duplication images. The results appear in Table I, showing several trends regarding the hash functions: aHash. The average Hamming distance of non- duplicate images from the original images using aHash is 28.22. Hence, it seems aHash performs well for capturing modifications that include adding logos and text and pixe- lating the image, having an average Hamming distance of 0.43-0.54. aHash additionally performs relatively well for resized, zoomed or cropped images, and when the image or background colors are modified (with a Hamming distance value of 10-13.5), but does not perform as well for flipped, rotated or mirrored images, having an average Hamming distance of 25. pHash. The average Hamming distance of non- duplicate images from the original images using pHash is 30.9. Similar to aHash , pHash performs well for capturing modifications that include adding logos and text and pixelating the image, and does not perform as well for flipped, rotated or mirrored images. dHash. This hashing function does not perform well for NFT duplication detection, as it has an average Hamming distance of \u2248 32 from all duplications while having a similar distance of 32.8 from non-duplicated images. wHash. Similar to dHash , this hashing function does not perform well for NFT duplication detection, as it has an average Hamming distance of \u2248 32 from all duplications while having a similar distance of 32.56 from non-duplicated images. HSVHash. The average Hamming distance of non- duplicate images from the original images using HSVHash is 7.22. Hence, HSVHash performs well for capturing modifications that include adding logos and text and pixelating the image (with an average distance lower than 0.53). As it is based on the color histogram, HSVHash does not perform well on color changes such as a change in the image or background colors, having Hamming distances of 3.81 and 4.62, respectively. sHash. The average Hamming distance of non-duplicate images from the original images using sHash is 27.24. sHash performs very well at capturing texts, logos, or emoji additions, having an average Hamming distance of 0.97. This hash function is relatively bad at capturing im- ages with colors swapped and flipped, rotated, or mirrored duplications, having an average Hamming distance higher than 16 for these categories. As Table I presents only the Hamming average of each case and not how the distances are distributed, Fig. 8- Fig. 13 present the histogram of the Hamming distances of each hash function compared to each modification cat- egory. In blue appear the Hamming distances of duplicate images, while in red appear the Hamming distances of the non-duplicated images in this category. Additionally, for fit histograms, a dashed separation line was added. This analysis helps understand better the separation between duplicated and non-duplicated images in each criterion.\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Original image\n\nFig. 2. Rotated\n\nFig. 3. Cropped\n\nFig. 4.

A good separation indicates the hash function can be used to identify between duplications and non-duplications of this duplication criterion. We define four ranks of separation, based on the percentage of possible mistakes using the best threshold possible: very good - if there exists a separation point D such that there are less than 5% misclassifications, good - if there exists D such that there are than 5 \u2212 10% misclassifications, medium - if there exists D such that there are than 10 \u2212 20% misclassifications, bad - if there does not exist any separation point D with less than 20% misclassification. As dHash and wHash were not effective, they were neglected from Fig. 8-Fig. 13. Fig. 8 shows no hash function can perfectly separate image duplications that were flipped, rotated or mirrored from non-duplicated images. That said, the HSVHash can identify duplicate images good , as more than 95% of duplicate images had a Hamming distance smaller than 2.5 compared to the original image, where less than 5% of the non-duplicated images had a Hamming distance that small. Using D = 3 . 33 , there are around 9% mis- classifications. This makes the HSVHash the only eligible hash function for detecting flipped, rotated or mirrored duplications. For resized, zoomed, cropped, repositioned or modified borders and edges (Fig. 9), pHash and aHash are not a suitable fit for detecting duplications. For HSVHash , less\n\nthan 10% of duplications have a Hamming distance larger than 3.33, while only 6% of non-duplicated images have a Hamming distance smaller than 3.33 from the original image. sHash performs medium too, using D = 18 , having 20% correct classifications. When adding logos or text to the images (Fig. 10), as they are a small part of the image, all four hash functions can separate between duplicated and non-duplicated images very good . For background color change (Fig. 11), as HSVHash is color-based and affected by the colors of an image, this hash function cannot be of much use when trying to detect a background color change. Meanwhile, sHash has more than 95% of the duplicated images with a Hamming distance lower than 12.5, while more than 99 . 5% of non- duplicates had a higher distance, performing very good for D = 12 . 5 . For a similar separation point, pHash can separate correctly 99% of the non-duplicated images and 91% of the duplicated images, performing good in total. For a Hamming distance of 8.33, aHash can separate between 90% of duplicated images and 4% of non- duplicated images, performing medium for D = 8 . 33 . For pixelated images (Fig. 12), all hash functions can separate duplicated images from non-duplicated ones. HSVHash performs good , while all other hash functions perform very good . Finally, for duplications with Colors swapped, modified or saturated (Fig. 13), when applying aHash , more than 98% of duplications have a Hamming distance higher than 8.33, while no non-duplicate image had a lower Hamming distance, making it very good for\n\n4\n\n0 4 . 17 8 . 33 12 . 516 . 6720 . 83 25 29 . 1733 . 3337 . 541 . 6745 . 83\n\n0\n\n5 \u00b7 10 \u2212 2\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 15\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 25\n\nHamming Distance\n\nFrequency\n\n(a) aHash\n\n0 4 . 17 8 . 33 12 . 516 . 6720 . 83 25 29 . 1733 . 3337 . 541 . 6745 . 83\n\n0\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 3\n\nHamming Distance\n\nFrequency\n\n(b) pHash\n\n0 0 . 83 1 . 67 2 . 5 3 . 33 4 . 17 5 5 . 83 6 . 67 7 . 5 8 . 33 9 . 17 0\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 3\n\nHamming Distance\n\nFrequency\n\n(c) HSVHash\n\n0 4 . 17 8 . 33 12 . 516 . 6720 . 83 25 29 . 1733 . 3337 . 541 . 6745 . 83\n\n0\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 4\n\n0 . 6\n\nHamming Distance\n\nFrequency\n\n(d) sHash\n\nFig. 8.

IMAGE -HASHING -BASED DUPLICATION DETECTOR\n\nSection III shows the potential of image hashing to detect NFT duplications. Next, we created several image- hashing-based duplication detectors and compared them.\n\nA. Creating Detectors\n\nUsing the analysis of Section III-B, we implemented a duplication detector (classifier) for each of the four hash functions: aHash , pHash , HSVHash and sHash . Our main interest was increasing the percentage of correctly identified image duplications while maintaining a low false-positive rate (less than 5% wrong classifications for non-duplication images). Based on the results of Sec- tion III-B, we created the single hash detectors, using the separation point D value that performs the best. That is, D is used as a threshold, and if the calculated Hamming distance of an image, compared to the original image, is lower than D , it is classified as a duplication. Otherwise, it is classified as a non-duplicated image. The values that produced the highest duplication detec- tion percentage were: aHash D = 8 . 33 , pHash D = 16 . 67 , HSVHash D = 3 . 33 , sHash D = 18 . As Section III-B shows there was no single hash function that performed well for all duplication cases, and no single hash function was overwhelmingly better than others, we suggest using multiple hash functions for duplication detection can increase the performance. We implemented three different duplication detectors: (i) Minimal Distance Detector. In this detector, all four hash functions are used. Each hash function defines a separation point D , and the Hamming distances are cal- culated for each hash function. If for any of the functions, the distance is lower than D , the image is classified as a duplication. Otherwise, it is classified as a non-duplication image. Similar to the single hash detectors, the parameters used for this detector are aHash D = 8 . 33 , pHash D = 16 . 67 , HSVHash D = 3 . 33 , sHash D = 18 . (ii) 2-Minimal Distance Detector. This detector is similar to the minimal distance detector, except now an image is classified as a duplication only if at least two hash functions indicate the image is duplicated. In our evaluation, we used similar values to the Minimal Distance. (iii) Combined Hash Detector. In this method, we tried to find some rules based on all four hash functions for the detection of duplications. For instance, when aHash , pHash and sHash all have a Hamming distance lower\n\nthan 4.17, there does not exist any duplication. Similarly, when the distance of HSVHash is lower than 3.33 and the distances of both pHash and sHash are lower than 16.67, the image is almost certainly a duplication. Hence, based on the results of Section III-B we derived several rules that if one of them applies to an image, it is classified as a duplication.\n\nB. Detectors Evaluation\n\nAs presented in Section III-A, 80% of the data was used for the evaluation in Section III-B which helped to tune the parameters of each detector, whereas the other 20% were used for testing the detectors to avoid biased results. Each detector was evaluated on both duplicated images and non- duplicated images. The main goal of our detectors was to increase the duplication detection percentage as much as possible while keeping a relatively low false-positive rate. Table III presents the performance of the four sin- gle hash detectors together with the minimal distance detector, 2-minimal distance detector, and the combined hash detector. The table shows that though all four single hash detectors could classify correctly 70 \u2212 79% of the duplication images, the detectors using multiple hash functions achieved more than 81% success in detecting duplications. This shows that as each hash function cap- tures different image manipulations, using multiple hash functions can improve duplication detection. Moreover, the minimal distance detector reached 95% success in detection duplications, and the combined hash detector even reached 97 . 5% . This performance is achieved while having a small false-positive rate, as both the minimal distance detector and the combined hash detector have a percentage of 95 . 5% for classifying non-duplicated images correctly.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we presented the potential of using image hash functions for detecting NFT duplications. We consid- ered six different image hash functions and examined the performance of each function on different image duplica- tion types. Later, we created image duplication classifiers based on these results. Our analysis shows that image hash functions have the potential to be a fast and reliable method for detecting NFT duplications and that using mul- tiple hash functions can increase performance. In future work, we intend to examine more hash detection functions and check if other distance metrics, such as cosine similar- ity, can help increase performance. Additionally, we intend to explore ways to improve our detectors, such as using preprocessing actions on images or using an ML model to improve the combined hash detector model. Finally, we intend to evaluate the performance of NFT duplications that include multiple and more complex manipulations and design an efficient construction to simplify the similarity check process.\n\n6\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] W.

        "abstract": "In this work, we review existing cryptocurrency wallet solutions with regard to authentication methods and factors from the user's point-of-view. In particular, we distinguish between authentication factors that are verified against the blockchain and the ones verified locally (or against a centralized party). With this in mind, we define notions for $k-factor$ authentication against the blockchain and $k-factor$ authentication against the authentication factors. Based on these notions we propose a classification of authentication schemes.  We extend our classification to accommodate the threshold signatures and signing transactions by centralized parties (such as exchanges or co-signing services). Finally, we apply our classification to existing wallet solutions, which, we moreover compare based on various security and key-management features.",

Decentralized cryptocurrency platforms allow users to conduct monetary transfers, write smart contracts, make loans, etc., while benefiting from features that centralized platforms cannot guarantee, such as decentralization, censor- ship resistance, integrity, transparency, 100% availability, etc. Cryptocurrencies utilize native crypto-tokens (a.k.a., coins), which can be transferred in transactions authenticated by private keys that belong to crypto-token owners. The users owning crypto-tokens interact with the cryptocurrency through a wallet software that manages their private keys. Unfortunately, there are many cases of stolen keys and attacks on e.g., brain wallets [1], [2], cryptocurrency ex- changes [3], [4], [5], [6], and even hardware wallets [7] with Cortex M3/M4 micro-controllers (such as Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, etc.). Such cases have brought the research commu- nity\u2019s attention to the security issues related to key manage- ment in cryptocurrencies [8], [9], [10], [11].\n\nA. Existing Surveys\n\nThe works of Eskandri et al. [8] and Bonneau et al. [10] proposed a categorization of cryptocurrency wallets concern- ing key management. The works of Huoy et al. [12] and Erinle et al. [11] reviewed broad vulnerabilities and defenses related to wallets while they specified their categorizations. Suratkar et al. [13] focused on a review of wallets concerning supported\n\nThis work was supported by the Chips JUProject LoLiPoP-IoT, grant agreement 101112286 as well as the FITBUT internal project FIT-S-23-8151.\n\ncoins, anonymity, cost, platform support, key management, and recovery methods. Karantias [14] reviewed a few categories and instances of wallets concerning the verification of trans- actions, privacy, communication complexity, and censorship.\n\nB. Authentication Schemes of Wallets & Security Issues\n\nWe base on the works of Eskandri et al. [8] and Bonneau et al. [10], who focus on the key management approaches, and we review and extend their categorizations. Private keys are encrypted with selected passwords in password-protected wallets . Unfortunately, users often choose weak passwords that can be brute-forced if stolen by malware [15]; optionally, such malware may use a keylogger [10], [16]. Another similar option is to use password-derived wallets that generate keys based on the provided password. However, they also suffer from the possibility of weak passwords [2]. Hardware wallets enable only the signing of transactions, without revealing the private keys stored on the device. However, these wallets do not protect from an attacker with full access to the device [17], [18], [19], and more importantly, some wallets do not have a secure channel for informing the user about the details of a transaction being signed (e.g., [20]) may be exploited by malware targeting inter-process call mechanisms [21]. A popular option for storing private keys is to deposit them into server-side hosted (i.e., custodial) wallets and currency- exchange services [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In contrast to the previous categories, server-side wallets imply trust in a provider (storing the private keys of the wallets), which is a potential risk of this category. Due to many cases of compromising server-side wallets [28], [29], [30], [31], [3] or fraudulent currency-exchange operators [32], client-side hosted wallets [33], [34], [35], [36], [37] (and their sub- category of embedded wallets [38], [39]) have started to proliferate. In such wallets, the main functionality, including the storage of private keys, has moved to the user side; hence, trust in the provider is reduced, but the users still depend on the provider\u2019s infrastructure. To increase the security of former wallet categories, multi- factor authentication (MFA) is often used, which enables spending crypto-tokens only when several secrets are used together. Wallets from a split control category [8] provide MFA against the blockchain. This can be achieved by threshold cryptography wallets [9], [40], [41], multi-signature wallets\n\n[42], [43], [44], [45], and state-aware smart-contract wallets [46], [47], [48]. Nevertheless, these schemes impose additional usability implications, performance overhead, or cost of wallet devices. In sum, while there exist studies categorizing cryp- tocurrency wallets with regards to security [10], [8], [12], [11], [14], there has not been any study that would deal with the classification of wallets based on locally-verified and blockchain-verified authentication factors and their intercon- nection, which is the motivation for our work.\n\nC. Contributions With the existing key management approaches in mind, we aim to distinguish the type of wallet authentication principle(s) and procedure concerning the wallet factors and their central- ized and/or decentralized verification.\n\n1) In particular, we propose a classification scheme for cryptocurrency wallets based on the authentication factors used for centralized and decentralized authentication.\n\n2) To define the classification of authentication schemes of wallets, we introduce two new notions: k -factor authenti- cation against the blockchain and k -factor authentication against the authentication factors.\n\n3) We further extend our classification to accommodate threshold-signature approaches and centralized services that sign or co-sign transactions.\n\n4) We extend the categorization of wallets from the previ- ous works [8], [10], while we also apply our proposed classification to reviewed wallets and their types.\n\nII. CLASSIFICATION OFA UTHENTICATIONS CHEMESIn this section, we introduce our classification scheme for cryptocurrency wallets. We denote the user by U and her client interface (e.g., the user agent/browser) as C .\n\nA. Classification In the context of the blockchain, we distinguish between k-factor authentication against the blockchain and k-factor au- thentication against the authentication factors themselves from U \u2019s point-of-view. For example, an authentication method may require U to perform 2-of-2 multi-signature to execute a transfer, while U may keep each private key stored in a dedicated device \u2013 each requiring a different password. In this case, 2FA is performed against the blockchain since all blockchain miners verify both signatures. Additionally, one- factor authentication is performed once in each device of U by entering a password in each of them. For clarity, we classify authentication schemes by the following:\n\nZ + X 1 \u000e . . . \u000e XZ\n\n!\n\n, (1)\n\nwhere Z \u2208{ 0 , 1 , . . . } , the first operand of \u201c+\u201d, represents the number of authentication factors against the blockchain and X i \u2208{ 0 , 1 , . . . } | i \u2208 [1 , . . . , Z ] , the second operand of \u201c+\u201d, represents the number of authentication factors against the i -th factor of Z (i.e., local authentication to access a particular factor). Hence, the \u201c+\u201d operator represents the con- nector between blockchain-verified factors and locally-verified\n\nfactors that are \u201dsummed\u201d or \u201cadded on\u201d to each other. With this in mind, we remark that the previous example provides (2 + 1 / 1) -factor authentication: twice against the blockchain (i.e., two signatures), once for accessing the first device (i.e., the first password), and once for accessing the second device (i.e., the second password).\n\n1) Extension for Threshold-Signature Co-Signing : Since the previous notation is insufficient for authentication schemes that use secret sharing [49] and threshold signatures, we extend it as follows:\n\nZ ( W 1 ,...,WZ ) + \u0010 X 1 1 , . . . , XW 1 1\n\n\u0011 /. . ./ \u0010 X 1 Z , . . . , XW ZZ\n\n\u0011 !\n\n, (2)\n\nwhere Z has the same meaning as in the previous case, W i \u2208 { 0 , 1 , . . . } | i \u2208 [1 , . . . , Z ] denotes the minimum number of secret shares required to use the complete i -th secret X i (or enable to co-sign a transaction). With this in mind, we remark that the aforementioned example provides \u0000 2 (1 , 1) + (1) / (1) \u0001 - factor authentication: twice against the blockchain (i.e., two signatures), once for accessing the first device (i.e., the first password), and once for accessing the second device (i.e., the second password). We consider an implicit value of W i = 1 ; hence, the classification (2 + 1 / 1) represents the same as the previous one (i.e., the first notation suffices). If one of the private keys were additionally split into two shares, each encrypted by a password, then such an approach would provide \u0000 2 (2 , 1) + (1 , 1) / (1) \u0001 -factor authentication.\n\n2) Extension I for Factors Provisioned by Centralized Service(s) : Since the previous scheme is not sufficient to express whether some factor verified at the blockchain was signed/produced by a centralized service such as exchange or other (e.g., upon some off-chain authentication of U ), we extend the previous notation as follows:\n\n( Z \u2212 Y ) ( W 1 ,...,WZ \u2212 Y )\n\n+ \u0010 X 1 1 , . . . , XW 1 1 \u0011 \u000e . . . \u000e \u0010 X 1 Z \u2212 Y , . . . , XW Z \u2212 Y\n\nZ \u2212 Y\n\n\u0011\n\n(3)\n\n+ V 1 \u000e . . . \u000e VY\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere the first two lines have the same meaning as Eq. 2 with the only difference that Z is \u201cdecreased\u201d by Y : the number of blockchain-verified factors that were produced by a centralized party or more such parties (i.e., 3rd party wallet providers). Therefore, the \u201c-\u201d operator puts blockchain-verified factors produced by U versus a centralized party(-ies) into a relation. Thus, the 3rd line of Eq. 3 expresses the number of factors V i that U have to present to a centralized party i for successful authentication, \u201cauthorizing\u201d it to use a blockchain- verified secret for U -requested operation (e.g., a signature on U \u2019s transaction) \u2013 these factors \u201cadd on\u201d the former ones, hence we use the + sign. For example, if U logins to a centralized exchange by login/password and provides OTP for the execution of an external transaction, while the centralized exchange owns\n\nthe private key used for signing a transaction, then such a scheme would provide ((1 \u2212 1) + 2) -factor authentication. In another example, if U owns one private key in her local wallet (protected by a password) and requires a centralized party to make a multi-signature on her transaction (upon authentication by login/password + OTP), such a scheme would provide ((2 \u2212 1) + 1 + 2) -factor authentication.\n\n3) Extension II for Factors Provisioned by Centralized Service(s) : Centralized services can, alternatively 1 to the independent blockchain-verified secrets, also store co-signing secrets that produce a valid blockchain-verified signature upon co-signing by U (e.g., using threshold-based signatures). Therefore, we extend our notation as follows:\n\nZ ( W 1 \u2212 Y 1 ,...,WZ \u2212 YZ )\n\n+ \u0010 X 1 1 , . . . , XW 1 \u2212 Y 1 )\n\n1 \u0011 / . . . / \u0010 X 1 Z , . . . , XW Z \u2212 YZ )\n\nZ \u0011\n\n+ V 1 \u000e . . . \u000e VY\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere the first two lines have the same meaning as Eq. 2 with the only difference that W i is \u201cdecreased\u201d by Y i : the number co-signing shares for blockchain-verified factor i ( i \u2208 { 1 , . . . , Z } ) which were produced by a centralized party (or more such parties). Therefore, the \u201c-\u201d operator puts shares of blockchain-verified factors produced by U versus a centralized party(-ies) into a relation. Thus, the 3rd line of Eq. 4 expresses the number of factors V i that U have to present to a centralized party i for successful authentication, \u201cauthorizing\u201d it to use a share of blockchain-verified secret for U -requested operation (e.g., a co-signature on U \u2019s transaction) \u2013 these factors \u201cadd on\u201d the former ones, hence we use the + sign. For example, if U owns one private key in her local wallet (protected by a password) and requires a centralized party to make a co-signature on her transaction (upon authentication by login/password + OTP), such a scheme would provide (1 (2 \u2212 1) + 1 + 2) -factor authentication.\n\n4) Potential Extension for Local Factors of Centralized Party : We remark that our notation could be straightforwardly extended to express the \u201clocal\u201d protection of blockchain- verified authentication factors stored by a centralized party (e.g., using threshold cryptography, encryption by passwords, hardware wallets with PIN, etc). However, since we focus on authentication from the user point of view, and this information is mostly an internal matter of a centralized party, which cannot be verified in the case it is disclosed, we do not include it neither into our notation nor reviewed examples.\n\nIII. REVIEW OFW ALLETT YPES\n\nWe extend and revise the previous work of Eskandari et al. [8] and Bonneau et al. [10], by categorizing and reviewing\n\n1 We note that this notation could be combined with the notation from Sec. II-A2; however, since it is unusual, we omit this combination.\n\na few examples of key management solutions, while demon- strating the application of our classification (see Sec. II) to each wallet. We remark that the categories are not necessarily disjoint and one wallet may thus belong to more than one category. Out of the categories presented in this section, 3 are unique (i.e., Sec. III-E, Sec. III-F, and Sec. III-G) and 2 are revised (i.e., Sec. III-C and Sec. III-H) in contrast to Eskandari et al. [8]. Also, note that Bonneau et al. [10] outlines the split-control category as an extension of [8] but mention only threshold signatures and multi signatures with Bitcoin script in contrast to us.\n\nA. Keys in Local Storage\n\nIn this category of wallets, the private keys are stored in plaintext form on the local storage of a machine, thus providing (1 + 0) -factor authentication. Examples that have historically enabled the use of unencrypted private key files are Bitcoin Core (until version 0.3) [50] 2 , Electrum (before ver- sion 1.9) [43] and MyEtherWallet (until 2018) [51] 3 wallets. However, MyEtherWallet discouraged U s from the local stor- age of private keys within the browsers since 2018 and mainly focused on integration with hardware wallets, while providing only a user interface for interaction with the hardware wallets. Unencrypted private keys in Bitcoin Core (which comes only as a standalone application) were possible until version 0.3, however, later the wallet required password protection and enabled integration with hardware wallets through an external bridge called Hardware Wallet Interface [52]. Electrum wallet (which comes only as a standalone application) has followed Bitcoin Core and also enabled integration with hardware wallet and two-factor authentication.\n\nB. Password-Protected Wallets\n\nThese wallets require U -specified password to encrypt a private key stored on the local storage, thus providing (1+1) - factor authentication. Examples that support this functional- ity are Armory Secure Wallet [42], Electrum Wallet [43], MyEtherWallet [51], Bitcoin Core [50], and Bitcoin Wallet [53]. This category addresses physical theft, yet enables the brute force of passwords and digital theft (e.g., keylogger).\n\nC. Password-Derived & Seed-Derived Wallets\n\nPassword-derived and seed-derived wallets (a.k.a., brain wallets and hierarchical deterministic wallets [54], [55]) can deterministically compute a sequence of private keys from a single password and or high-entropy seed, respectively. This approach takes advantage of the key creation in the ECDSA signature scheme that many blockchain platforms use. Examples of early password-derived wallets (for one of the configuration options) are Electrum [43], Armory Secure\n\n2 Note that since Bitcoin Core enables password-protected private keys, it also belongs to the next category. 3 Note that MyEtherWallet also enables to use of password-protection of private keys, and thus it also belongs to the category of password-protected wallets. At the same time, this wallet belongs to the category of client-side hosted wallets since, besides browser extension (or locally run DAPP), it can run from the server (which is the most common option).\n\nWallet [42], Metamask [56], and Daedalus Wallet [57]. 4 The wallets in this category provide (1+ X 1 ) -factor authentication (usually X 1 = 1 ). While hierarchical deterministic wallets with high enough seed entropy provide enough resistance to brute-forcing, password-derived wallets might suffer from weak passwords [2], [58]. Vasek et al. [58] found that most of the brain wallets with weak passwords in Bitcoin were drained within 24 hours from creation.\n\nD. Hardware Storage Wallets\n\nIn general, wallets of this category include devices that can only sign transactions with private keys stored inside sealed storage, while the keys never leave the device. To sign a transaction, U connects the device to a machine and enters a passphrase. When signing a transaction, the device displays the transaction\u2019s data to U , who may verify the details. Thus, wallets of this category usually provide (1 + 1) -factor authentication. Popular USB (or Bluetooth) hardware wallets containing displays are offered by Trezor [59], Ledger [60], KeepKey [61], and BitLox [62]. An example of a USB wallet that is not resistant to tampering with C (e.g., keyloggers) is Ledger Nano [20] \u2013 it does not have a display, hence U cannot verify the details of transactions being signed. An air- gapped transfer of transactions using QR codes is provided by ELLIPAL wallet [63]. In ELLIPAL, both C (e.g., smartphone App) and the hardware wallet must be equipped with cameras and display. (1 + 0) -factor authentication is provided by a credit-card-shaped hardware wallet from CoolBitX [64]. A hybrid approach that relies on a server providing a relay for 2FA is offered by BitBox [65]. Although a BitBox device does not have a display, after connecting to a machine, it communicates with C running on the machine, and at the same time, it communicates with a smartphone App through BitBox\u2019s server; each requested transaction is displayed and confirmed by U on the smartphone. One limitation of this solution is the lack of self-sovereignty.\n\nE. Split Control \u2013 Threshold Cryptography\n\nIn threshold cryptography [49], [66], [67], [68], a key is split into several parties which enables the spending of crypto-tokens only when n-of-m parties collaborate. Threshold cryptography wallets provide \u0000 1 ( W 1 ,...,W n ) + ( X 1 , . . . , X n ) \u0001 - factor authentication, as only a single signature verification is made on a blockchain, but n verifications are made by parties that compute a signature. Therefore, all the computations for co-signing a transaction are performed off-chain, which provides anonymity of access control (i.e., a transaction has a single signature) in contrast to the multi-signature scheme that is publicly visible on the blockchain. An example of this category is presented by Goldfeder et al. [9]. One limitation of this solution is a computational overhead directly proportional to the number of involved parties m (e.g., for m = 2 it takes 13 . 26 s). Another example of this category is a USB dongle Mycelium Entropy [40], which, when connected to a printer,\n\n4 Note that the password-based key derivation has been possible for one of the options or some versions.\n\ngenerates triplets of paper wallets using 2-of-3 Shamir\u2019s secret sharing; providing (1 (2) + (0 , 0)) -factor authentication. A hybrid example from this category (and client-side hosted wal- lets) is Zengo Wallet [41], which uses 2-of-2 co-signing, where the U owns one key (protected by PIN) and Zengo server owns another key (protected by email/password and 3D face lock). At the same time, U generates an encryption key that is used to back up her co-signing key at the Zengo server, while the encryption key is stored at U \u2019s cloud provider, enabling U to recover the co-signing key. This example provides thus (1 (2 \u2212 1) + 1 + 2) -factor authentication.\n\nF. Split Control \u2013 Multi-Signature Wallets.\n\nIn the case of multi-signature wallets, n-of-m owners of the wallet must co-sign the transaction made from the multi- owned address. Thus, the wallets of this category provide ( n + X 1 / . . . /X n ) -factor authentication. One example of a multi-owned address approach is Bitcoin\u2019s Pay to Script Hash (P2SH). 5 Examples supporting multi-owned addresses are Lockboxes of Armory Secure Wallet [42] and Electrum Wallet [43]. A property of a multi-owned address is that each transaction with such an address requires off-chain com- munication. A hybrid instance of this category and client- side hosted wallets category is Trusted Coin\u2019s cosigning ser- vice [44], which provides a 2-of-3 multi-signature scheme \u2013 U owns a primary and a backup key, while TrustedCoin owns the third key. Each transaction is signed first by U \u2019s primary key and then, based on the correctness of the OTP from Google Authenticator, by TrustedCoin\u2019s key. Therefore, this approach provides (2 \u2212 1) + 1 + 1 -factor authentication. Another hybrid instance of this category and client-side hosted wallets is Bitpay Wallet (former Copay) [45]. With Bitpay, U can create a multi-owned Bitpay wallet (for Bitcoin), where U has all keys in his machines and n-of-m keys co-sign each transaction. Transactions are resent across U \u2019s machines during multi-signing through Bitpay.\n\nG. Split-Control \u2013 State-Aware Smart Contracts\n\nState-aware smart contracts provide \u201crules\u201d for how owners can spend crypto-tokens of a contract, while they keep the current setting of the rules on the blockchain. The most common example of state-aware smart contracts is the 2-of- 3 multi-signature scheme that provides (2 + X 1 /X 2 ) -factor authentication. An example of the 2-of-3 multi-signature ap- proach that only supports Trezor hardware wallets is Trezor- Multisig2of3 from Unchained Capital [46]. One disadvantage of this solution is that U has to own three Trezor devices, which may be an expensive solution that, moreover, relies only on a single vendor. Another example of this category, but using the n-of-m multi-signature scheme, is Parity Wallet [47]. However, two critical bugs [69], [70] have caused the multi-signature scheme to be currently disabled. The n-of-m multi-signature scheme is also used in Gnosis Wallet from ConsenSys [48]. The Gnosis multi-sig smart contract is also\n\n5 We refer to the term multi-owned address of P2SH for clarity, although it can be viewed as Turing-incomplete smart contract.\n\nutilized in Bitpay wallet [45] (for Ethereum). A hybrid ex- ample of this category is Argent wallet [71], which runs as a smart contract that optionally enables to switch into 2-of-2 multi-signature mode, where one key is held in U \u2019s browser or smartphone App (protected by a password) and another key is stored at Argent\u2019s server, which co-signs U transaction upon successful email-based OTP verification, ((2 \u2212 1)+1+1) -factor authentication. In the case of a forgotten password, the Argent contract enables U (with only one private key) to switch off this feature after 7 days of inactivity. Another example of this category are SmartOTPs [72] that require the blockchain to verify signature in the first stage and One Time Password (OTP) in the second stage. The signature is provided by a hardware wallet (protected by PIN), and OTP is provided by the authenticator device or the smartphone App (protected by a password/fingerprint). Therefore, this solution also provides (2 + (1/1)) authentication. Moreover, SmartOTPs enable recovery of lost secrets by last resort address that can receive all funds of the wallets without any authentication upon elapsing a certain last resort timeout of inactivity (e.g., in months).\n\nH. Hosted Wallets\n\nCommon features of hosted wallets are that they provide an online interface for interaction with the blockchain, managing crypto-tokens, and viewing transaction history. At the same time, they also store private keys on the server side. If a hosted wallet has full control over private keys, it is referred to as a server-side wallet . A server-side wallet acts like a bank \u2013 the trust is centralized. Due to several cases of compromising such server-side wallets [3], [4], [5], [6], [28], [29], [30], [31], the hosted wallets that provide only an interface for interaction with the blockchain (or store only user-encrypted private keys) have started to proliferate. In such wallets, the functionality, including the storage of private keys, has moved to U \u2019s browser (i.e., client). We refer to these kinds of wallets as client-side wallets (a.k.a., hybrid wallets [8] and embedded wallets).\n\nServer-Side Wallets . Coinbase [22] is an early example of a server-side hosted wallet, which also provides exchange services. Whenever U logs in or executes an operation, he authenticates himself against Coinbase\u2019s server using a pass- word and obtains a code from Google Authenticator/Authy app/SMS/utilize passkeys. Other examples of server-side wal- lets having similar security levels to Coinbase are OKX [73] and Bitfinex [74]. Another example is Binance [23], which, on top of the login/password, requires U to provide 2 OTPs to perform the external operation with the wallet \u2013 one from the Google Authenticator and another one from the email on top of login and password. The wallets in this category usually provide ((1 \u2212 1)+2) -factor authentication when 2FA is enabled or ((1 \u2212 1) + 3) -factor authentication when 3FA is enabled.\n\nClient-Side Wallets . An example of a client-side hosted wallet is Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet [75], which requires (on top of encryption password) PIN or biometrics to access the wallet, and it provides 1-factor authentication against the blockchain. Moreover, it enables cloud backup of private keys, encrypted\n\nby the user-specified (unrecoverable) password. Equivalent functionality and security level as in BTCWallet is offered by Blockchain DeFi Wallet [76], which is an independent part of a combined client-side and server-side wallet. 6 Other examples of this category are password-encrypted wallets, like Mycelium Wallet [33], CarbonWallet [34], Citowise Wallet [35], Coinomi Wallet [36], and Infinito Wallet [37], which, in contrast to the previous examples, do not store backups of encrypted keys at the server. A 2FA against the blockchain is provided in addition to password-based authentication, in the case of CarbonWallet. In detail, the 2-of-2 multi-sig scheme uses the PC\u2019s browser and the smartphone\u2019s browser (or the app) to co-sign transactions. The wallets in this category usually provide (1 + X 1 ) -factor authentication, where X 1 is usually equal to 1 (in the cases of 2FA, it might be equal to 2). Argent wallet [71] is a wallet for Starknet (the L2 blockchain under Ethereum), which by default protects a private key stored in a browser by a password. It optionally provides even more flexible features thanks to smart contracts (see state-aware smart contracts above). Another example from this category is Harmony One wallet [77], which focuses on the usability of small-amount transfers. It requires U to login by a password, and then for each operation with the wallet she provides OTP from Google Authenticator only. In contrast to many other solutions, OTP is verified at the blockchain as the only factor required to execute the operation. 7 Since U has no private key, the relaying services of Harmony make the signing of the transaction (to pay the fees).\n\nEmbedded Wallets . Embedded wallets can be viewed as a subcategory of client-side hosted wallets since they contain most of their features. The only difference is that they do not need to run as a dedicated DAPP (on a new URL or locally as a browser extension) but they can run directly from the website of any service provider, and thus U does not need to leave its website nor interact with the browser extension. An example of this category is Thirdweb embedded wallet [38], enabling U to login to the wallet (and create its local private key) either by 3rd party authentication method OAuth [78] (through Google) or by sending OTP to U \u2019s email. In both cases, U needs to have access to the email of her account, which usually requires at least the password to access the email (i.e., (1 + 1) -factor authentication). However, since the key is stored at U \u2019s device in plain text (in the case of a browser in the local storage), it is subject to extraction by malware and lacks the means for recovery. Another similar example is Beam wallet (with Join integrated) [39], [79], which in contrast to Thirdweb wallet, provides OAuth login through X or email-based OTP verification. Moreover, it enables encryption of locally stored private keys by a password (thus providing (1 + 2) -factor authentication).\n\nIV. SECURITY FEATURES OFW ALLETS\n\n6 Note that server-side wallet uses a different key. 7 Note that client stores a salt for OTP, increasing the security of OTP.\n\nWe present a comparison of wallets and approaches from Sec. III in Tab. I of Appendix. In detail, we apply our proposed classification of authentication schemes, while we also survey a few selected security properties of the wallets that also contain some features from the work of Eskandri et al. [8] (marked by the \u2217 in their original form and + in their revised form). In the following, we briefly describe each property. 1) Air-Gapped Property : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that involve at least one hardware device storing secret information, which does not need a connection to a machine for its operation. 2) Resilience to Tampering with the Client : We attribute this property (Y) to all hardware wallets that sign transactions within a device, while they require U to confirm transaction details at the device (based on displayed information). Then, we attribute this property to wallets containing multiple clients that collaborate in several steps to co-sign transactions (the chance that all of them are tampered with is low). 3) Post-Quantum Resilience : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that utilize hash-based cryptography that is known to be resilient against quantum computing attacks [80]. 4) No Need for Off-Chain Communication : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that do not require an off-chain communication/transfer of transactions among parties/devices to build a final (co-)signed transaction, before submitting it to a blockchain (applicable only for Z \u2265 2 or W i \u2265 2 ). 5) Malware Resistance (e.g., Key-Loggers) \u2217 : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that either enable signing transactions inside of a sealed device or split signing control over secrets across multiple devices. 6) Secret(s) Kept Offline \u2217 : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that keep secrets inside their sealed storage, while they expose only signing functionality. Next, we attribute this property to paper wallets and fully air-gapped devices. 7) Independence of Trusted Third Party \u2217 : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that do not require a trusted party for operation, and we do not attribute this property to all client-side and server-side hosted wallets. We partially (P) attribute this property to approaches requiring an external relay server for their operation. 8) Resilience to Physical Theft \u2217 : We attribute this property (Y) to approaches that are protected by an encryption password or PIN. We partially (P) attribute this property to approaches that do not provide password and PIN protection but have a specific feature to enforce the uniqueness of an environment in which they are used (e.g., Bluetooth pairing). 9) Resilience to Loss of Secrets + : We attribute this prop- erty (Y) to approaches that provide means for the recovery of secrets (e.g., a seed of hierarchical deterministic wallets).\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, we proposed a classification of cryptocurrency wallets based on authentication methods and their factors. In the classification, we distinguished between centralized (or local) authentication and decentralized authentication against\n\nthe blockchain. We demonstrated the application of our clas- sification scheme in various categories and instances of the wallets that we also reviewed and cross-compared based on several security features from the literature.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] J.-P.

        "body": "I. INTRODUCTION The Ordinal protocol, launched on the Bitcoin mainnet in Jan, 2023, has opened new avenues for users to innovate within the Bitcoin blockchain. This is achieved through the cre- ation of inscriptions , which function similarly to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) [ 1 ] found on other blockchains. Following its launch, Bitcoin inscriptions quickly garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market. As of now, there have been over 55M ( #Dune ) Bitcoin inscriptions created. Previous studies have explored various aspects surrounding this new hype. Razi et al. [ 2 ] present a thorough overview of NFT (including Bitcoin NFT) and survey the current landscape of NFT applications across various domains. Wang et al. [ 3 ] delve into the surge of interest and activity surrounding BRC20 tokens and critically examine the narratives of their hope and hype based on market sentiment. Louis [ 4 ] delves into the factors influencing transaction fees in the context of Bitcoin Ordinals and assesses their impacts on the Bitcoin network. While these works have contributed elegant insights, our research distinguishes itself by offering a distinct perspective. We focus on providing a comprehensive interpretation of the most fundamental aspects of inscriptions, delving deeper than the surface-level usage or construction in prior works.\n\n\u2022 We provide a technical review dedicated to Bitcoin in- scriptions (Sec. II ), covering techniques including SegWit, Schnorr sig., Taproot, Tapscript, and Ordinal Theory.\n\n\u2022 We present Bitcoin inscriptions\u2019 operational mechanisms (Sec. III ), detailed by an examination of the working prin- ciples, a comparative analysis with conventional NFTs, and the potential use case built on Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\n\u2022 We discuss challenges and opportunities from a forward- looking view (Sec. IV ). Especially, we emphasize Bitcoin Layer2 and derivative protocols related to inscriptions.\n\nII. PRELIMINARIES ANDB ACKGROUNDSegregated witness. SegWit was proposed to address the scalability issue by changing the way transaction data is structured and stored in the blocks (cf. Fig. 1 ). Firstly, a SegWit transaction consists of two main components: the original transaction structure (without the signature) and a separate\n\nwitness section containing the signatures and scripts. It is worth noting that the signature data is separated from the main transaction data. The witness information is still transmitted and stored in the blockchain but is no longer a part of the transaction\u2019s txid calculation. The txid is now calculated without including the witness data, effectively resolving the transaction malleability issue. This change means that the txid remains constant even if the signature data is altered. Secondly, SegWit introduces a new concept called block weight , which is a blend of the block\u2019s size with and without the witness data. The maximum block weight is set to 4MB, while the size of the non-witness data is still capped at 1MB [ 5 ]. This effectively allows for more transactions to be included in each block, improving the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nFigure 1: Bitcoin Transaction Data Structure (SegWit)\n\nSchnorr signature. The Schnorr signature consists of three main algorithms: key generation , signing , and verification . Key generation establishes a secure private-public key pair. The signing algorithm then creates a unique signature for each message, combining a random nonce, a hash function, and the private key. The verification algorithm checks the signature\u2019s validity against the message and public key. The Schnorr sig- nature enables more data to be embedded within a transaction while minimizing the space it occupies on the blockchain. The compact nature of the Schnorr signature allows for more inscriptions without significantly increasing the size of the blockchain. Furthermore, it helps mitigate privacy concerns by making multi-signature transactions indistinguishable from single-signature ones. Taproot/Tapscript. In comparison, BIP-341\u2019s Taproot allows for the compression of data in inscription transactions, re- ducing their size and improving scalability. BIP-342 enables batch verification of signatures, which is crucial for multi- signature transactions often used in inscriptions. To further illustrate the working principle of BIP-341 and BIP-342, we consider a situation where a Bitcoin address is controlled by three parties: A, B, and C. We created a Taproot output address that allows for flexible spending conditions using MAST and Tapscript (Fig. 2 ). The spending conditions are: (i) any two of the three parties (A, B, C) can jointly spend\n\nthe funds ; and (ii) if the funds are not moved for a year, party A can unilaterally spend them (a time-lock condition). Initially, the parties aggregate their individual public keys ( pk A , pk B , pk C ) to form a single Schnorr Internal public key P. This aggregate key, alongside the Merkle root derived from two hashed scripts (Script1 adds up the valid signatures and ensures that at least two signatures are provided; Script 2 uses OPCheckSequenceVerify to enforce the time-lock, ensuring the script can only be executed after a year. Then it checks the signature from A), and forms the Taproot output. When time to spend, the parties can opt for a key-path spend using P for a private transaction, or a script-path spend, revealing the chosen script and its Merkle proof to fulfill specific conditions.\n\nFigure 2: Taproot and Tapscript\n\nThe Ordinal theory. Bitcoin Ordinal Theory introduces the uniqueness within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It brings the idea of assigning distinct identities to individual satoshis (sats), the smallest unit of Bitcoin (100 M-ths of a Titcoin), allowing for their precise tracking and utilization in various applications. Satoshis are numbered in the order they are mined, and this numbering is maintained as they are transferred from transaction inputs to outputs, adhering to a first-in-first-out principle. Ordinal numbers are essentially a numbering scheme for satoshis, allowing each satoshi to be tracked and transferred as an individual entity. Additionally, Ordinal Theory intro- duces a system of rarity based on periodic events in Bitcoin, such as blocks, difficulty adjustments, halvings, and cycles. This system categorizes satoshis into different rarity levels like common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic.\n\nIII. UNDERSTANDING BITCOIN INSCRIPTIONS\n\nA. Working Principle (Inscribing Data&Associating Ordinals)\n\nThe working principle is as follows (Fig. 3 ): Firstly, the data intended for inscription is first prepared in a suitable format. This often involves encoding the data into a byte string that can be embedded in a Bitcoin transaction. The data is typically accompanied by a MIME type that specifies the nature and format of the content (e.g., image/jpeg, text/plain), ensuring compatibility with web standards. This alignment with web standards means that inscription content can be retrieved and rendered by standard web browsers, similar to how they handle regular web content served from a server. Inscription content is encapsulated within a structure known as an \u201cenvelope\u201d, which uses Bitcoin taproot script-path spend script opcodes OPFALSE , OPIF , ..., OPENDIF . Taproot scripts benefit from the witness discount introduced by SegWit,\n\nwhich reduces the size and cost of storing witness data compared to other transaction data.\n\nFigure 3: Working Principle of Bitcoin Inscriptions\n\nCreating the inscription transaction has two phases. In the first phase (called the commit transaction), a taproot output is created, which commits to a script containing the inscription content. This script is constructed in such a way that it cryptographically references the data without revealing it. The transaction is then broadcast and included in a block on the blockchain. In the second phase, a subsequent transaction (the reveal transaction) is made to spend the output from the commit phase. This spending transaction includes the actual inscription data within its script. When confirmed, inscription data becomes permanently recorded on-chain. Finally, the unique ordinal number of the selected satoshi is tracked through these transactions. As ordinals follow a first- in-first-out principle, such ordinal number is transferred from the input satoshi to the output satoshi (the commit transaction) and to the inscribed satoshi (the reveal transaction).\n\nB. Differences Between Bitcoin Inscriptions and Other NFTs\n\nProtocol and description method. Bitcoin inscriptions op- erate on the Ordinal protocol, embedding data directly into individual satoshis, and are described as digital assets, or- dinals, or inscriptions. In contrast, NFTs on platforms like Ethereum utilize standards such as ERC721 or ERC1155 , and are commonly referred to as NFTs. This fundamental difference in protocol form shapes the inherent properties and possibilities of each asset type. Storage and immutability. Bitcoin inscriptions are entirely stored on-chain, ensuring complete immutability and per- manence. Once an inscription is embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, it becomes unalterable. This method ensures the durability of the inscribed content, with the cost of inscriptions being proportional to the content\u2019s size. On the other hand, NFTs on other blockchains often rely on off-chain storage solutions like IPFS [ 6 ] and Arweave , introducing potential challenges in content availability and permanence. The degree of immutability for these NFTs can vary, with some being alterable or deletable by the contract owner. This variability necessitates a thorough audit of the contract code to ascertain the immutability of an NFT. The auditing process can be complex and technically demanding. Minting and trading. Minting Bitcoin inscriptions currently requires a node or third-party services, and the trading of these inscriptions occurs through NFT marketplaces. Other NFTs can often be minted directly through web interfaces and are\n\n2\n\nalso traded on NFT marketplaces. However, the integration of Bitcoin inscriptions with other platforms is challenging due to Bitcoin\u2019s scripting limitations, while NFTs on programmable blockchains offer more seamless integration.\n\nScarcity. Bitcoin inscriptions are inherently limited by the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. Since they are directly tied to individual satoshis, their scarcity is intrinsically linked to the total supply of Bitcoin, which is capped at 21M coins [ 7 ]. This finite supply of satoshis imposes a natural limit on the number of possible inscriptions. On platforms like Ethereum, the creation of NFTs is often governed by smart contracts that allow for flexible minting policies. Creators can generate large quantities of NFTs with minimal cost, which can potentially lead to a saturation of the market. While some NFT projects on other blockchains impose a cap on the number of tokens, others do not, allowing for an unlimited supply. This flexibility means that the scarcity of NFTs on these platforms can vary significantly from one project to another.\n\nRoyalty models. Bitcoin inscriptions do not inherently support on-chain royalty models. This means that when a Bitcoin inscription is transferred or sold, there is no automatic mecha- nism within the Bitcoin blockchain to provide a percentage of the sale back to the original creator. Many NFTs on platforms like Ethereum utilize smart contracts that can include on- chain royalty models. These contracts automatically enforce that a certain percentage of every secondary sale of the NFT is paid to the original creator. The presence of on-chain royalty models offers ongoing compensation for creators but introduces complexity and standardization challenges.\n\nIntegration and energy consumption. Bitcoin inscriptions benefit from direct integration into the largest and most established cryptocurrency market, with immediate access to a vast and liquid market, but it is difficult to integrate into other platforms due to Bitcoin\u2019s scripting limitations. On the other hand, their energy consumption is high due to Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work consensus. In contrast, NFTs on other blockchains are confined to specific ecosystems with varying energy footprints based on the consensus algorithm of the platform.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages. Bitcoin inscriptions offer the advantages of scarcity and the characteristics of luxury goods. However, they face challenges such as slow block speed, complexities in minting and trading, and a complex wallet setup. Other NFTs enjoy a mainstream mode and a high user base but may lack unique features or recognition, potentially leading to market saturation.\n\nC. Use Cases\n\nFungible token standard. On March 8, 2023, an anonymous developer named domodata launched the BRC20 . The BRC- 20 token standard represents an experimental approach to cre- ating fungible tokens using ordinal inscriptions. This standard is akin to Ethereum\u2019s ERC20 but is uniquely tailored for the Bitcoin network. ORDI is the first BRC20 token issued on the Bitcoin network, with a total supply of 21,000,000 tokens. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s ERC20 tokens, ORDI is not a smart\n\ncontract token. It operates without the support of underlying technology, project teams, real-world project applications, or defined use cases. The valuation of ORDI is essentially driven by community consensus and the dynamics of market interest (also known as the meme coins). Creating such a coin comes at no cost; each one faces competition from other, more \u2018meaningful\u2019 meme coins. For instance, another BRC20 token, SATS , competes in this space. Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100M satoshis, and the SATS token has set its total supply at 21T, mirroring the maximum number of 21T satoshis.\n\nDigital art & collectibles. Bitcoin inscriptions can offer artists and collectors an innovative approach to creating and trading digital works. It leverages the capability to inscribe digital assets directly onto individual satoshis on Bitcoin, ensuring each piece\u2019s authenticity and permanence. A notable example of this is the creation of Ordinal Punks , which draw inspiration from the iconic CryptoPunks on Ethereum. These pixel-art characters, each with unique features and levels of rarity, are inscribed onto satoshis, turning them into highly desirable collectibles within the digital art sphere. Furthermore, writers and poets are finding a new medium for their work through Bitcoin inscriptions. Entire poems or short stories can be inscribed onto satoshis, creating a unique form of literary art. For instance, a poem by Ana Maria Caballero sold for 0.28 Bitcoin (equiv. $11,430) at Sotheby\u2019s , one of the world\u2019s most famous auction houses.\n\nGaming assets. Leveraging the immutable nature of the Bit- coin blockchain, gaming assets inscribed as ordinals provide players with ownership of unique in-game items, characters, or even entire game worlds. The Pizza Ninjas gaming project intertwines the thrill of gaming with the world of digital collectibles. Each Pizza Ninja character is not only a playable asset but also a piece of art. By inscribing these unique characters and narratives onto Bitcoin, the project ensures the rarity and ownership of every in-game element.\n\nIV. CHALLENGES ( - ) ANDO PPORTUNITIES ( + )\n\n- Blockchain bloat. It refers to the increase in the size of the blockchain due to the accumulation of data over time. From Jan. 1 to the time of writing, the total cumulative trad- ing volume for Inscriptions on Bitcoin was 53.6M ( #Dune ), making Bitcoin the third most popular NFT network by trading volume next to Ethereum and Solana. The increased demand for block space due to inscriptions leads to longer transaction validation times. Bitcoin\u2019s block time is about 10 minutes, but the inclusion of inscriptions in the transaction pool can increase the backlog of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. This backlog can delay the confirmation of both financial transactions and inscriptions. Since Apr. 2023, the mempool has experienced a continuous backlog, marking the most extended period of sustained congestion without clearing since the spike of on-chain activity observed in early 2021.\n\n- Limited smart contracts. It refers to Bitcoin\u2019s inherent design, which prioritizes security and simplicity over complex programmability. Unlike Ethereum designed to support a wide\n\n3\n\nrange of decentralized applications through smart contracts, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is more restricted. This limitation impacts the blockchain\u2019s ability to support complex transac- tions and scalable applications, particularly those requiring intricate logic and interactions.\n\n- Adoption and usability. The adoption and usability of Bitcoin inscriptions pose significant challenges, especially for non-technical users, primarily due to the inherent complexities of the Bitcoin blockchain and the relatively nascent state of the technology. Engaging with Bitcoin inscriptions requires a deeper understanding of blockchain operations than NFTs on more user-friendly platforms such as Ethereum. Users must navigate the technicalities of managing Bitcoin wallets that support inscriptions, understand the process of inscribing data onto satoshis, and grapple with the nuances of transaction fees and network congestion. Moreover, the current ecosystem for Bitcoin inscriptions lacks the mature and intuitive interfaces that have been developed for other blockchain technologies, which further steepens the learning curve. This gap in user accessibility could hinder widespread adoption, as potential users might be deterred by the initial technical barriers and the lack of streamlined, user-friendly tools.\n\n- Increased transaction fees. Inscriptions often involve em- bedding additional data into a Bitcoin transaction. The larger and more complex this data, the more space it occupies in a block, driving up transaction fees. As inscriptions become more popular, they contribute to network congestion, further elevating the costs. In the first half of 2023, miners accumu- lated 8,684 BTC in total fees. Notably, transactions related to inscriptions during H1 2023 made up 1,779 BTC or 20% of total miner revenue. This is in comparison to the 2,325 bitcoins in fees for H1 2022 and the 5,375 bitcoins in total fees amassed throughout the entirety of 2022 ( #Dune ). During periods of intense activity related to inscriptions, users may find themselves competing for inclusion in the next block by paying higher fees. This competition can drive up the average transaction fee on the network, affecting all users, not just those creating inscriptions.\n\n+ Inscription derivative protocols. The surge in popularity of Bitcoin inscriptions has led to a proliferation of derivative pro- tocols and imitative projects. These innovative protocols sum- marised have further enriched the Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems. We are aware that the BRC20 protocol is limited to tokens with only four letters and is susceptible to front- running attacks. To improve upon BRC20, ARC20 , removes the four-character limit, allowing for more diverse gameplay possibilities. Rune aims to issue fungible tokens by directly inserting token data into UTXO scripts. Rune\u2019s implementa- tion is similar to ARC20 but includes token quantities in the script data, lending it increased legitimacy. Additionally, RGB transforms smart contract states into concise proofs inscribed in BTCUTXO output scripts. It offers low transaction costs and high scalability. For other blockchains, DRC20 on Dogecoin is similar to BRC20 but popular due to low transaction costs and strong\n\nmeme appeal. Ethscriptions protocol on the Ethereum chain introduced \u201cdumb contracts\u201d, bringing functionality and prac- ticality. ASC20 , BSC20 , PRC20 on other EVM-compatible chains also enable inscription and index building for projects like AVAL, BNBS, and POLS. SOLs on Solana began in November 2023, with a total of 21,000,000 inscriptions. The main focus is on NFTs, with indexing based on image or file hashes. SFNs is recognized as the first inscription on the EOS chain. It adopts the AtomicAsset standard, which provides a powerful feature set while minimizing unnecessary complexity and focusing on RAM efficiency. In addition, MRC20 powered by the Move blockchain offers an efficient and user-friendly approach to token management. APT20 is an experimental token standard that facilitates the creation and transfer of fungible tokens through the Ordinals protocol on Aptos.\n\n+ Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. BTCLayer2 is a layer above the BTC blockchain, primarily aimed at solving scalability issues of the BTC network. Currently, there are several mainstream Layer2 solutions. The core concept of ZKRollups [ 8 ] is to bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This process uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify bundled transactions without exposing details. The current ZKRollups have raised concerns about centralization, as they primarily rely on centralized sequencers. Additionally, Rootstock (RSK) [ 9 ] leverages merged mining to attain a level of security on par with Bitcoin, thereby achieving scalability. However, its approach to merged mining introduces certain risks. Moreover, Stacks [ 10 ] pioneers decentralized mining and bridging with Bitcoin. Despite these innovations, challenges related to user experience, transaction fees, and network effects could impede its wider acceptance. Overall, Layer 2 technology is still in a phase of continuous exploration, with a long way to go before it reaches maturity and widespread applicability. + Interoperability for Bitcoin inscriptions. Bitcoin inscrip- tions currently face limitations in interoperability and lack effective liquidity mechanisms. Establishing the infrastructure to provide liquidity is one of the key directions to propel the development of the Bitcoin inscription ecosystem. There are only a few existing works relating to this. For exam- ple, BRC721E standard enables the migration of verifiable ERC721 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin Ordinals. During the bridging of NFTs, BRC721E encodes NFT data directly into a burn transaction. It\u2019s important to note that the burn transaction is irreversible, which means that currently, it\u2019s impossible to convert an Ordinal back into an ERC721 NFT. Therefore, we consider this reversibility a potential research direction for the future. Additionally, MultiBit enables the transfer of tokens between BRC20 and ERC20, and TeleportDAO supports the transfer and trading of assets between BTC and Polygon. In summary, research on the interoperability of Bitcoin in- scriptions is currently limited. Most existing protocols support transactions between single chains and Bitcoin inscriptions. Achieving a level of interoperability and liquidity comparable to NFTs on Ethereum needs more effort.\n\n4\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Qin Wang et al.

                "In the evaluation section, the impact of transaction costs, including gas price, should be considered, or at least their roles should be mentioned. This is because a significant share of DEX liquidity lies on Ethereum's main chain, incurring substantial gas costs. This extends to the analysis in Figure 5, where instead of ETH price, gas price is more relevant as one can expect arbitrage transactions to reduce with increasing gas prices. Lastly, the runtime of the algorithm is not discussed. This is important as arbitrage is a time-sensitive opportunity. Thus, an end-to-end time of data fetching, processing and algorithm runtime would be helpful.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a prominent field within the blockchain ecosystem, leveraging blockchain technology to create financial applications that are open, transparent, and accessible to anyone. A crucial field of DeFi is the decentralized exchange (DEX) which allows peer-to- peer trading of tokens without the necessity of intermediaries [1]. Just like in the foreign exchange market (Forex), the prices of the same token in DEXs may differ significantly across different liquidity pools, which creates many arbitrage op- portunities [1], [2]. A liquidity pool is a smart contract that facilitates the exchange of two different tokens.\n\nAmong various DEXs, Uniswap is the largest DEX in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) 1 . Uniswap adopts the constant product market maker (CPMM) mechanism [3] to determine the exchange rate between a pair of tokens in a liquidity pool. Under the CPMM model, the price of each token equals the ratio of the two tokens\u2019 reserves in the liquidity pool. The Uniswap exchanges can be mapped to a directed weighted token exchange graph G ( V, E, P ) , where nodes ( V ) represent tokens, an edge ( E ) denotes a liquidity pool containing the pair of tokens at the two ends of the edge, and the edge weight ( P ) denotes the exchange rate between the two tokens in the liquidity pool. The exchange rate is determined by the reserve of each token in the liquidity pool. Extensive arbitrage research in DEXs has shown that Uniswap provides abundant arbitrage opportunities due to tokens\u2019 price discrepancies in different liquidity pools [1], [2]. Combined with the \u201cwalk to the root\u201d algorithm, the Moore- Bellman-Ford (MBF) algorithm was commonly used in de- tecting loop arbitrage opportunities in DEXs by recognizing negative loops 2 . A negative loop is a loop in which the summation of all edges\u2019 weights is negative. For the arbitrage problem, an edge usually corresponds to a liquidity pool containing tokens at the two ends of the edge, and the weight of a specific edge is the log of the exchange rate of the pair of tokens in the liquidity pool. However, the drawback of the MBF combined algorithm method is that only several arbitrage loops can be recognized after each run and it can not be used for detecting non-loop arbitrage opportunities if the negative loops exist. Against this background, this work focuses on developing a new method by combining the line graph of the token graph G ( V, E, P ) and a modified Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm (MMBF) to identify more arbitrage opportunities on Uniswap V2 3 , including not only more arbitrage loops but also non-\n\n1 Currently, it has 3.62 billion USD in TVL according to Defillama (https: //defillama.com/protocol/uniswap-V2) (accessed Nov. 15, 2023) 2 We will use the \u2018MBF combined algorithm\u2019 simply to refer to the MBF algorithm combined with the \u201cwalk to the root\u201d algorithm in the later description. 3 Uniswap has 3 versions, this work primarily focuses on Uniswap V2 which has a TVL of 1.33 billion USD on November 15, 2023. Despite the launch of Uniswap V3, trading activities on Uniswap V2 are still active and the number of new pairs created is even more than before as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nloops between any pair of tokens. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1) We develop an arbitrage detection algorithm that can not only find more profitable arbitrage loops than the MBF combined algorithm but also detect arbitrage non-loop between any pair of tokens on Uniswap.\n\n2) We present an empirical analysis of the identified arbi- trage opportunities by our algorithm and by the MBF combined algorithm.\n\n3) We calculate the arbitrage profit that existed in the token graph at different times by our algorithm and provide insights into the efficiency of Uniswap with time. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work in the field of arbitrage detection on DEXs. Section 3 describes the data sources and data processing. Section 4 presents the details of our method for identifying arbitrage opportunities. Section 5 compares the arbitrage opportunities found by applying both our method and the MBF combined algorithm, including the identified arbi- trage opportunities and profits. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the findings and a discussion of their implications.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nAfter the appearance of the DEXs for tokens, like Uniswap V2, though still in its early stage, some scientific papers have focused on analyzing the arbitrage opportunities of DEX. Wang et al. [4] analyze the potential cyclic arbitrage opportunities and explored arbitrage profit by traversing all tri- angles containing Ether (ETH, the native token of Ethereum), included on Uniswap V2. Robert et al. [5] recognized the arbitrage transactions in the historic trade event log and ap- plied Johnson\u2019s cycle-detection algorithm to look for potential arbitrage opportunities. Zhou et al. [6] applied the MBF combined algorithm to recognize arbitrage loops. Danos et al. [7] took the arbitrage problem as a convexity problem and applied the optimization operation to find arbitrage paths from a theoretical perspective. Berg et al. [8] applied the method in [7] on Uniswap V2 to research the efficiency of DEX by recognizing profitable arbitrage opportunities. In the arbitrage detection field, the Moore-Bellman-Ford (or Bellman-Ford-Moore) algorithm combined with the negative detection algorithm \u201cwalk to the root\u201d is a vital method. Originally, MBF alone was used to find the shortest path from one specific node to all other nodes in a graph. In case any negative loop exists, MBF fails to find the shortest path among nodes. A negative loop is characterized by the property that the cumulative weight of all edges within the loop is negative. When it comes to arbitrage in DEXs, a negative loop denotes an arbitrage loop which is similar to the cyclic arbitrage opportunities in Forex. In an arbitrage loop, if we invest a unit of some specific asset, then we can always get more units of this specific asset by trading along the arbitrage loop. Hence, much research dedicated to detecting such arbitrage loops in DEXs [4]\u2013[6], [9], [10].\n\nHowever, a very significant shortcoming of looking for arbitrage by applying the MBF combined with the negative detection algorithm \u201cwalk to the root\u201d is that it can only recognize very few arbitrage loops each time, and we can not even specify the starting token for the arbitrage loop. Besides arbitrage loops, another critical point is whether we can find a shorter non-loop path between a pair of nodes correctly. If a shorter non-loop between a pair of tokens is found, we can also get arbitrage profit by combining the path on DEX and the tokens\u2019 prices from the centralized exchanges (CEX). The MBF combined algorithm is not suitable directly on token graphs for looking for non-loop paths between a pair of nodes if negative loops exist in the network.\n\nIII. DATA DESCRIPTION\n\nA. Data Source\n\nThe token pairs that can be exchanged with each other are also called token liquidity pools in this paper. Their informa- tion on Uniswap V2 is obtained from the The Graph 4 , which provides detailed information for each token of the liquidity pools, such as tokens\u2019 addresses, names, symbols, reserves, and decimals. This information is then used to construct a token graph with nodes representing tokens and edge weights representing the exchange rates between two corresponding tokens. To identify potential arbitrage opportunities with time, we retrieve historical daily snapshots from The Graph , which encompass the daily trading volume in USD and reserves of each token in the liquidity pool. The exchange rate of each pair of tokens is determined by their reserve ratio in the same liquidity pool. Furthermore, to calculate the profits gained in USD for arbitrage opportunities, we also collect the tokens\u2019 prices from CEXs. Finally, the analyzed data spans from 1st September 2020 to 31st October 2023. Fig. 1 provides holistic statistics about the daily number of newly created pools and daily transaction volume in Uniswap V2.\n\n2020-07 2021-01 2021-07 2022-01 2022-07 2023-01 2023-07 2024-01\n\nDate\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nNew pairs created per day\n\nUniswap V3 launches\n\n2020-07 2021-01 2021-07 2022-01 2022-07 2023-01 2023-07 2024-01\n\nDate\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nDaily Trading Volume(USD)\n\n1e9\n\nFig. 1: New pairs created and trading volume per day. The daily number of newly created pools after the launch of Uniswap V3 continued to increase and surged to 678 even on October 24th, 2022, and further spiked to 835 on July 25th, 2023. Moreover, despite the daily trading volume declining a bit following the launch of Uniswap V3, it still maintained a consistently high level and occasionally exceeded five hundred million USD.\n\n4 https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ianlapham/uniswap-V2-dev\n\nB. Data Processing\n\nTo provide a comprehensive overview of the market on any given day, we generated the daily token liquidity pool snapshot of the whole market first. There have been more than one hundred thousand tokens as of October 31, 2023. The tokens\u2019 liquidity pool data can be used to construct the token graph. In the token graph, nodes present tokens, and an edge is linked between two tokens if there is a liquidity pool containing both of them simultaneously. In this way, all token pools can be connected as a token graph G ( V, E, P ) with V as the token set, E as the token liquidity pool set, and P as the exchange rate set. However, the computation complexity is very high if all tokens are contained in our analysis, and we can not arbitrage if a token\u2019s degree is one (meaning there is only one pool that contains the specific token), we need to filter pools or tokens when building our token graph. We take the following steps to filter tokens and pools:\n\n\u2022 Calculate the first trading date and the last trading date for each pool. This is to filter active pools in constructing the token graph.\n\n\u2022 On each day, we select only those pools whose Total Values Locked (TVL) are larger than twenty thousand dollars and that are still active (meaning pools whose first trading date is on or before the specific date but whose last trading date is equal or later than this specific date) to build the token graph.\n\n\u2022 After the graph is constructed, we delete all tokens from the graph whose degree is one.\n\n\u2022 The number of tokens in the graph is set as one hundred. If the total number of tokens in the graph is larger than one hundred, then we delete pools with the smallest TVLs. Deleting pools may trigger the deleting of other pools or tokens. So, the process of deleting pools is iterative. After one pool with a smaller TVL is deleted, we check whether the degree of the tokens that are in the deleted pool but still in the token graph is less than 2. In case some token\u2019s degree is less than 2, then we delete the corresponding token and the pool that contains the deleted token again. Because a new pool is deleted, we use the same steps above to delete tokens and pools again.\n\n\u2022 Run the above procedures of deleting tokens and pools from the graph until there are only one hundred tokens left in the graph. The above is the procedure of how we construct the token graph. After filtering, the graph has one hundred tokens and roughly the first four hundred liquidity pools with the most liquidity. The first largest four hundred liquidity pools in TVL take about 90% of the total TVL and correspond to about one hundred different tokens. This is why we chose one hundred tokens and about four hundred liquidity pools in our research.\n\nIV. METHOD\n\nOur method in arbitrage loop and non-loop detection mainly includes 4 steps. Firstly, we need to construct a token graph\n\nG ( V, E, P ) based on the tokens\u2019 liquidity pool data on Uniswap V2. Secondly, we construct the line graph L ( G ) ac- cording to the token graph G ( V, E, P ) . Thirdly, we introduce a MMBF method and apply it on L ( G ) to detect the arbitrage loop and non-loops. At last, for each arbitrage loop and non- loop, we use the bisection method to maximize the arbitrage profit.\n\nA. Constructing Token Graph\n\nG ( V, E, P ) is a weighted directed token graph, where v i \u2208 V is the i th token in the token set V ( i = 1 , 2 , ...N ), and e ij is the edge between token v i and v j . W denotes the edge weight set. The edge e ij represents a directed exchange by paying token v i to get v j . It can be expressed as e ij = ( v i , v j ) . For any pair of tokens v i and v j , there exist two different edges, the edge from token v i to v j ( e ij ) and the edge from token v j to v i ( e ji ), so, e ij \u0338 = e ji . Each edge has a corresponding edge weight. We use p ij ( \u2208 P ), the price of token v i in the unit of token v j , to denote the weight of edge e ij . It can be calculated simply by taking a negative log to the ratio between the reserve of the token v i and v j . So, p ij = \u2212 log ((1 \u2212 \u03bb ) r j\n\nr i ) , where r i and r j is the reserve of token v i and v j in the liquidity pool, respectively. \u03bb is the imposed tax rate by the liquidity pool. In the case of Uniswap 2 [11], \u03bb = 0 . 3% . Based on this formula, we know that p ij + p ji = \u2212 2 log (1 \u2212 \u03bb ) . We can construct the token graph G ( V, E, P ) based on what we described here and the token filtering method in Section III-B.\n\nB. Constructing Line Graph for Token Graph\n\nGiven the underlying graph G ( V, E, P ) , its line graph L ( G ) can be constructed by the following steps:\n\n\u2022 The edges ( e ij ) in the original underlying graph G ( V, E, P ) are taken as the new vertices of the line Graph L ( G ) . A new vertex in the line graph L ( G ) will be denoted as a tuple with its two entries representing the two tokens at the two ends of each edge ( e ij ) in G ( V, E, P ) . For example, in G ( V, E, P ) , the edge e ij is a directed edge from v i to v j . In L ( G ) , the corresponding new vertex will be ( v i , v j ) , i, j = 1 , 2 , ...N and i \u0338 = j .\n\n\u2022 Any pair of new vertices in line graph L ( G ) are linked if the last token of a new vertex is the first token of another new vertex. For example, assuming one new vertex in L ( G ) is ( v i , v j ) and another new vertex is ( v j , v l ) , then we add a link from the new vertex ( v i , v j ) to vertex ( v j , v l ) in L ( G ) . The new edge from ( v i , v j ) to ( v j , v l ) in L ( G ) can be denoted as ( v i , v j , v l ) or ( v i , v j ) \u2192 ( v j , v l ) . In this step, we also need to set weights for all edges in L ( G ) . The weight of edge ( v i , v j , v l ) (or ( v i , v j ) \u2192 ( v j , v l ) ) in L ( G ) is set as p jl which is the edge weight from token v j to v l in G ( V, E, P ) .\n\n\u2022 For any pair of new vertices in L ( G ) , ( v i , v j ) and ( v k , v l ) , if j = k , i = l and i \u0338 = j , then we cut both the two mutual links between the two vertices. This means we cut both the edge ( v i , v j , v i ) and edge ( v j , v i , v j ) in L ( G ) .\n\nBy cutting these edges, we can reduce the computation complexity because the arbitrage loops between a pair of tokens, like v i \u2192 v j \u2192 v i and v j \u2192 v i \u2192 v j , are non-profitable. The number of vertices in the new line graph ( ML ( G ) ) equals the number of edges in the underlying graph ( EG ), namely, ML ( G ) = EG . The number of edges in the line graph ( EL ( G ) ) equals the sum of the degree\u2019s square of each node minus two times the number of edges in graph G , namely EL ( G ) = P d i 2 \u2212 2 EG , where d i denotes the degree of token (node) i in the underlying graph G and EG denotes the number of edges of the underlying graph G .\n\nC. Modified Moore-Bellman-Ford (MMBF) on Line Graph with Extra Node According to the line graph constructing rules, each token in the original underlying graph G ( V, E, P ) is included in several different new vertices in the line graph L ( G ) . For example, assuming e ij and e ik are two edges starting from token v i in G ( V, E, P ) , both vertices ( v i , v j ) and ( v i , v k ) in L ( G ) contain the token v i . For the sake of simplicity, we call these vertices ( ( v i , v j ) and ( v i , v k ) ) in L ( G ) the \u2018neighbor link vertices\u2019 of v i , and that v j and v k constitute to the \u2018neighbor token set\u2019 of v i . These two concepts will facilitate our description below. We assume that N i ( v n 1 , v n 2 , ...v n i \u2208 N i ) is the neighbor token set of the specific token (source token) v i . Based on the constructing rule of line graph L ( G ) , v i has n i neighbour link vertices in L ( G ) , namely, ( v i , v n 1 ) , ( v i , v n 2 ) , ... , ( v i , v n i ) . To detect the arbitrage loop and non-loops, the MMBF can be used in two different ways in the line graph L ( G ) . One way is to calculate the shortest path between the source token\u2019s ( v i ) neighbor link vertices ( N i ) and all other vertices in L ( G ) . This method is very time-consuming because the MMBF will be applied once for each neighbor link vertex. We now present the second efficient way that we will apply in the paper. The second way simplifies the computation by adding an extra node to the line graph L ( G ) first and then applying the MMBF only once. The addition of an extra node is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Construct the line graph L ( G ) by steps as shown in section IV-B.\n\n\u2022 We assume that v 0 is the source token that we will consider and ( v 0 , v n 1 ) , ( v 0 , v n 2 ) , ... , ( v 0 , v n k ) are its neighbour link vertices in L ( G ) . Now, we add an extra node called ( O, v 0 ) to L ( G ) and link this vertex to all the neighbor link vertices of v 0 , namely, ( O, v 0 ) \u2192 ( v 0 , v n 2 ) , ... , ( O, v 0 ) \u2192 ( v 0 , v n k ) . ( O, v 0 ) is also called the source vertex in L ( G ) , and O is just a sign that is not important and can be any other sign.\n\n\u2022 The weight of each extra added edge in L ( G ) is set as the weight of the edge from the source token ( v 0 ) to all tokens in the neighbor token set of v 0 in G ( V, E, P ) , re- spectively. For example, the weight of the edge ( O, v 0 ) \u2192 ( v 0 , v n k ) is p v 0 v nk . Then we use the modified Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shorter paths from the source vertex ( O, v 0 ) to\n\nall other vertices in the line graph L ( G ) . The MMBF algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Modified Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm (MMBF)\n\nM \u2190 len ( G ) : the number of tokens in GLine graph: L ( G ) Source vertex: ( O, v 0 ) Edge weight of L ( G ) : WEdge weight of G : PDefine Dis and Path as two dictionaries to store distances and arbitrage paths from the source vertex (0 , v 0 ) to all other vertices in L ( G ) . for m = 1 , 2 , ..., M do\n\nfor Each edge ( v i , v j ) \u2192 ( v j , v l ) in L ( G ) do\n\nif Dis ( v i ,v j ) + W ( v i ,v j ) \u2192 ( v j ,v l ) < Dis ( v j ,v l )\n\nand ( v l / \u2208 Path ( v i ,v j ) or l = 0 ) then\n\nPath ( v j ,v l ) = Path ( v i ,v j ) + ( v j , v l ) ,\n\nDis ( v j ,v l ) = Dis ( v i ,v j ) + W ( v i ,v j ) \u2192 ( v j ,v l )\n\nend if\n\nend for\n\nend for Define D token and P token as two dictionaries to store distances and arbitrage paths from the source token v 0 to all other tokens in G . for Each key-value pair k d , v d in Dis do\n\nt = k d [ \u2212 1] if v d < D token [ t ] then\n\nD token [ t ] = v d P token [ t ] = Path k d\n\nend if\n\nend for return D token , P token\n\nBy applying MMBF on L ( G ) with an extra node, we can detect the arbitrage non-loops between any pair of tokens. At the same time, we can also get an arbitrage loop starting from the source token and back to the source token. For example, if the source token in is v 0 , and other tokens are v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n , we can get all arbitrage non-loops between v 0 and all other tokens v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n . At the same time, we can also get the arbitrage loop starting from v 0 and backing to v 0 again. If we take different tokens as the source token and repeat all the processes above, we can get the arbitrage non-loop between any pair of tokens and arbitrage loops from each token in the token graph G ( V, E, P ) finally. For a token graph with N tokens, the method can get N arbitrage loops and N 2 non- loops.\n\nD. Adjusting Input to Maximise the Arbitrage Profit\n\nAfter we find a profitable loop or non-loop, the next question is how much we should invest to maximize our arbitrage profit. This question is closely correlated with the tokens\u2019 exchange rates and liquidity depth in each liquidity pool. The constant Automate Market Marker (AMM) equation in the liquidity pool of Uniswap version 2 is:\n\n[ x + (1 \u2212 \u03bb )\u2206 x ]( y \u2212 \u2206 y ) = xy = k, (1)\n\nwhere x and y denotes the number of token x and y in the liquidity pool, respectively. \u03bb denotes the transaction tax rate. From the above equation, we know that \u2206 y is a con- cave function that increases monotonically with \u2206 x . As well known, if a function F ( \u00b7 ) is concave, then F ( G ( \u00b7 )) is also concave if function G ( \u00b7 ) is concave. When the path includes more tokens, the quantity of inputs for the starting token continues to exhibit a concave and monotonically increasing pattern concerning the number of target tokens being extracted. So, from the economic point of view, when the marginal output of the target token for each unit of the starting token is equal to the reserve ratio of the target token ( R y ) to the starting token ( R x ) in case that a liquidity pool containing both x and y exists, or equal to the market price of the token x to that of token y from the centralized market, the arbitrage profit is maximal. In the case of an arbitrage loop, the result is still applicable. When it is in terms of loops, the starting token and the target token are the same, so, they have the same price and we get the maximal profit when d (\u2206 y )\n\nd (\u2206 x ) = 1 . Because of\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nx\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\ny\n\nk = R y R x or P x P y y = f ( x )\n\nFig. 2: The profit is maximal when the marginal output of the target token ( y ) we get for a unit of starting token ( x ) is equal to the ratio of the target token reserve ( R y ) to the starting token reserve ( R x ), or equal to the two tokens\u2019 market price ratio ( P x\n\nP y ) with the prices from CEXs.\n\nthe concave and monotonically increasing function, it is very easy and efficient to use the bisection method to calculate the optimal input of the starting token to get maximal arbitrage profit.\n\nV. STATISTICS OFTHE POTENTIAL ARBITRAGE ONU NISWAPV2 BYO URM ETHODC OMPARINGTO THEMBF COMBINED ALGORITHM\n\nIn this section, we summarise several important statisti- cal findings by applying our methods to historical data on Uniswap V2 and then compare the results to those by applying the MBF combined algorithm. First, we depicted the distribution of the arbitrage path length of arbitrage paths found by both our method and the MBF combined algorithm, which is shown in Fig. 3. The number of arbitrage loops and non-loops by our method is much larger than that by the MBF combined algorithm, which denotes that our method can find more arbitrage opportunities than the MBF combined algorithm. The distribution of arbi- trage paths by our method is nearly symmetric, and we find that the length of most arbitrage paths ranges from 7 to 11.\n\nThe profitable paths whose length ranges from 3 to 6 and from 12 to 15 also take a very large percentage. The distribution of arbitrage loop length by the MBF combined algorithm is a lateral distribution in that most arbitrage loops have lengths of 3 and 4.\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nPath length\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nFrequency\n\n1e6\n\n(a) MMBF\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nPath length\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFrequency\n\n(b) MBF\n\nFig. 3: Distribution of the length of arbitrage paths. Panel 3a and 3b depicts the distribution of arbitrage path length by our method and the MBF combined algorithm, respectively.\n\nSecond, we depicted the distribution of potential profit in all arbitrage paths by applying our method and the MBF combined algorithm. Still, more arbitrage profits are found by our method than by the MBF combined algorithm, as shown in Fig. 4. The largest profit by our method can be a million dollars, compared to about one hundred thousand by the MBF combined algorithm. 23,868 arbitrage paths with more than a thousand dollars are found by our method, the number is only 19 by the MBF combined algorithm. We can find that a larger number of arbitrage possibilities are less than ten dollars. If we focus on the arbitrage opportunities whose profits are larger than one hundred dollars, we find that they follow almost a power-law distribution by our method. The arbitrage profit in most paths is hundreds of dollars. By checking the profit distribution, we find several paths in which the arbitrage profit can be up to almost one million dollars. We need to be aware that this potential arbitrage profit in this paper is only calculated in snapshots, which means that arbitrageurs can always find profitable paths or loops at any time. Finally, we\n\n10 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7\n\nArbitrage profit ($)\n\n10 1\n\n10 0\n\n10 1\n\n10 2\n\n10 3\n\n10 4\n\n10 5\n\n10 6\n\n10 7\n\nFrequency\n\n(a) MMBF\n\n10 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7\n\nArbitrage profit ($)\n\n10 0\n\n10 1\n\n10 2\n\nFrequency\n\n(b) MBF\n\nFig. 4: Distribution of potential arbitrage profit in the token graph. Panel 4a and 4b depicts the distribution of potential ar- bitrage profit by applying our method and the MBF combined algorithm, respectively.\n\nplot how the total detected potential arbitrage profit that exists in Uniswap V2 evolves with time by our method, which is shown in Fig. 5. Because the total arbitrage profit by the MBF combined algorithm is small, we do not plot it here. From Fig. 5, we can see that the total profitable arbitrage fluctuates. At the end of 2020, much potential profit existed in the Uniswap V2 network and it can be as high as ten million dollars on some days. Another finding is that the total profitable arbitrage seems to be cyclical. There are several large cycles (troughs and peaks). By making a rough and simple line regression, we find that the slope coefficient is about \u2212 0 . 002 , which denotes that the total profitable arbitrage has a trend to decline with time. We take this as an indication that the market mechanisms of DeFi, namely the AMM studied, Uniswap V2, are being arbitraged more efficiently, and thus Uniswap V2 can provide better price information to market participants. Further studies could involve comparing the volume of TVL locked-in tokens with arbitrage opportunities and relating the depth of these markets to the possible arbitrage.\n\nVI. RESULT ANDD ISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we integrate the line graph approach with a modified MBF algorithm to propose a novel method for identifying arbitrage opportunities in token networks. Com- pared with the MBF combined algorithm, an advantage of\n\n2021-01\n\n2022-01\n\n2023-01\n\nDate\n\n10 1\n\n10 3\n\n10 5\n\n10 7\n\nPotential Arbitrage (log scale)\n\nPotential arbitrage ($)\n\nRegression line (slope = -0.002)\n\nETH price ($)\n\nPotential arbitrage (ETH)\n\nBase line (10 ETHs)\n\nFig. 5: Potential profit from arbitrage by our method in Uniswap V2 with time.\n\nour method is that we can not only find valid and shorter paths for any pair of tokens but also identify loops originating from any source node. Another advantage is that our method can recognize more arbitrage opportunities than the MBF combined algorithm. By systematically applying our algorithm to each token in the network as a source, we can enumerate potential loops starting from each token and non-loops for every token pair, along with their respective maximum profits through optimal input token allocation. We applied our algorithm to historical data from Uniswap V2 (1st September 2020 to 31st October 2023) and found that a large number of potential arbitrage opportunities exist, which shows that our algorithm is effective in finding arbitrage opportunities. For example, more than a million dollars of arbitrage existed in the graph network at the end of 2020. In May of 2023, the potential arbitrage profit is still more than one hundred thousand dollars. Furthermore, we show that the total dollar value of these arbitrage opportunities decreased with time, which prompts further research exploration. We also tested the running time of our method in detecting the arbitrage paths in the token graph with one hundred tokens and about four hundred liquidity pools, and the running time is about 8-10 seconds, which means that it can be used in practical arbitrage detection. If the code is optimized again, we believe that our method can be faster. In a real case, we don\u2019t need to construct a token graph all the time, we just need to update the tokens\u2019 balance based on the latest transaction data, and then run the MMBF again, which means that this method can be faster in the real case. However, our approach is not without limitations and needs to improve. While our algorithm can find the valid arbitrage path between a pair of tokens compared with the MBF combined algorithm even in cases where many negative loops exist, this arbitrage path may not be the most profitable. This topic is very challenging in theory and will be the subject of our future research. Another limitation of this paper is that the gas fee is not considered. The gas fee is a significant factor that deserves to be considered in on-chain transactions. For simplicity, we can take it as a fixed cost, like fifty dollars for each transaction, or increase the tax rate \u03bb in equation 1, both of which will not change the analysis much in the paper.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] J.

INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent technological advancements in digital payments have led central banks globally to experiment with blockchain- based pilots for central bank digital currencies (CBDC) [18]. Traditionally central banks oversee money supply to maintain public trust in the financial system and currency stability. The evolution of the money supply has shifted from the gold- backed collateral regime to the fiat currency regime [42]. Modern-day central banks have been criticized for managing economic crises, potentially exacerbating issues through un- conventional methods such as quantitative easing and negative interest rates [13]. A well-designed CBDC could offer central banks a new approach to achieving policy goals, enhancing economic efficiency, inclusiveness, and fostering economic innovation [2], [33]. CBDCs are a digital fiat currency issued by a central bank and supported by the government\u2019s full confidence and trust [12], [16]. In various countries continued digital pay- ment innovation explores the potential advantages of digital\n\ncurrencies issued and backed by central banks [5], [35], [46]. However, many unanswered questions exist on how this CBDC will flow through to its users. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (2020) high- lights challenges in international collaboration and coopera- tion with CBDC adoption, particularly in cross-border pay- ments [46]. Lacking a universal understanding or standardized regulatory framework for CBDCs could impede cross-border transactions and trade. Varying perspectives and methods among countries regarding CBDC adoption underscore the importance of ensuring compatibility and smooth integration with existing payment infrastructures to support international transactions. Considerations for CBDCs involve balancing fraud detec- tion, privacy preservation, and avoiding excessive surveillance. Additionally, there is tension between the central bank\u2019s con- trol of money circulation and safeguarding individual free- doms. This paper contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive overview of CBDCs, summarizing key re- quirements and design challenges, clarifying distinctions be- tween CBDCs and related concepts, organizing requirements effectively, and discussing reasonable limitations for CBDC systems.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nTechnological advancements and changing consumer pref- erences are swiftly reshaping the financial ecosystem. Digital payments, widely adopted for convenience, are driving the transition to a cashless economy. They boost payment conve- nience, cut transaction costs, and enhance transparency, aiding in combating financial crimes such as money laundering\n\nA. Digital Payments\n\nDigital payment, also known as electronic payment, enables the transfer of digital money between accounts using ad- vanced technology. This encompasses various electronic fund transfer methods, serving as electronic alternatives for tradi- tional currency transactions. The prevalence of digital devices and internet connectivity has revolutionized digital payments [11], driving innovation from card payments to contactless transactions using mobile wallets, wearable devices, and QR codes [15], [34].\n\nB. CBDC\n\nWhat makes CBDC more special, given that the current money system is already digital? According to [10], the key difference between digital currency and CBDC is that while digital currency represents a claim on an intermediary, CBDC represents a direct claim on the central bank [9]. Another notable difference is that unlike cryptocurrencies, where open protocols control creation, transaction, and destruction, CB- DCs are issued and managed by the central bank, just like fiat currency. According to a BIS report [10], many central banks are actively engaged in CBDC research, focusing on how it could boost financial inclusion, improve efficiency in payment systems, enhance financial stability, foster payment innovation, and facilitate cross-border transactions. CBDC is a digital asset resembling traditional paper cur- rency, with legal tender status and traceability to its origin [17]. They are often discussed as digital cash with features like peer- to-peer payments and offline transactions, aiming to mirror physical cash in digital form, ensuring ease of use for everyday transactions and accessibility without internet connection [45]. However, specific design and functionality vary based on each central bank\u2019s policies and implementation choices. The predominant design formats for CBDCs are account- based and token-based [23], [32]. In the account-based model, transactions are continuously tracked within a ledger, whereas in the token-based model, transactions are represented as outputs, akin to Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO). There is ongoing industry debate regarding the suitability of each model for CBDCs [7]. Account-based CBDCs necessitate user identity verification, thus imposing Know Your Cus- tomer (KYC) requirements. Conversely, the token-based model emphasizes privacy and anonymity, resembling cash trans- actions [8]. Technically, token-based systems only need to validate the token\u2019s legitimacy and check if it has been previously spent, independent of the spender\u2019s identity. In contrast, account-based systems rely on trusted third parties to manage accounts and verify transactions before processing. Additionally, an offline CBDC model enables transactions without an internet connection [14]. As per a study [26], countries like Sweden, Norway, and Singapore aim to boost domestic demand for central bank money. Meanwhile, the United States, the European Union, and China focus on expanding international usage of their national currencies. Additionally, Uruguay, South Africa, and Cambodia aim to enhance monetary policy, promote financial inclusion, or address financial system de-dollarization.\n\nC. CBDC vs Digital Currency\n\nDigital money is a form of currency that exists only in electronic form. Digital money offers many socio-economic advantages, including convenient payment methods, reduced transaction costs, and enhanced transparency [19]. CBDCs are not merely digital versions or representations of digital currency. Instead, they function as digital tokens that underlie and support the value of a currency [41]. While both CBDCs and other digital money allow for electronic transactions and\n\nstorage, CBDCs can be designed to offer universal accessi- bility and are subject to governmental monetary policy and oversight. Other forms of digital money are tied to specific platforms, services, or financial products. The primary dis- tinction between CBDCs and other digital money lies in the issuing authority and the nature of the claim, with CBDCs backed by the central bank and integrated into the broader monetary system and other digital money only operating within specific platforms and services. CBDC tokens offer more advanced functionalities com- pared to traditional digital currencies. Transactions in digi- tal currencies can be categorized as either account-based or token-based [22]. In an account-based model, transactions resemble those of regular deposit accounts, necessitating the establishment of an account for conducting transactions and exchanging digital tokens. Each transaction requires accessing user information to verify both the sender and the recipient\u2019s identities. Conversely, token-based systems involve transfer- ring the value of digital objects between wallets. Transactions in token-based systems are authorized through public-private key pairs and digital signatures exchanged between the sender and the receiver [28].\n\nD. CBDC vs Cryptocurrency\n\nCBDC and cryptocurrency represent two distinct forms of digital money. CBDCs are issued and regulated by central banks, and their value is generally stable, tied to a nation\u2019s fiat currency. Conversely, cryptocurrencies are typically created by private entities or decentralised communities, and their value can be highly volatile. They often operate outside central banking systems and provide higher levels of privacy and anonymity. While CBDCs may or may not be based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies are mostly built on decentralised blockchain technology. In essence, CBDCs are digital extensions of traditional currency, aimed at modernising the existing monetary system, while cryptocurrencies seek to offer an alternative, often operating independently of govern- ment control and regulation. One of the major limitations of cryptocurrency transactions is the lack of regulatory support or oversight. Presently, cryp- tocurrency is subject to a diverse array of legal frameworks worldwide [40]. This absence of regulation can lead to a mul- titude of issues, including security concerns due to inadequate safeguards against fraud or theft, high volatility resulting in financial risk, potential legal and compliance risks, and obsta- cles in accessibility and usability. Without clear guidelines, users might inadvertently violate laws, such as anti-money laundering and tax regulations, leading to potential legal troubles. Additionally, this lack of regulatory backing might hinder the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems and create a lack of trust among potential users [37]. However, it is worth noting that some see this lack of regulation as a strength of cryptocurrencies, allowing for more freedom and innovation, but the call for regulatory clarity is growing in prominence as adoption increases.\n\nE. Tokens (NFTs) as a Programmed Currency\n\nThe concept of tokens (NFTs - Non Fungible Tokens) refers to a digital object issued on a platform. Tokens can represent various tangible and intangible assets like ownership rights, stakes in a company, access to services, or units of value stored electronically [36]. They are commonly used in blockchain- based platforms and applications to facilitate transactions, governance, or to provide incentives within a network. The token concept has revolutionised how value and rights can be transferred, managed, and stored, allowing for new models of collaboration, ownership, and investment in the digital age. A unique feature of a token in the context of CBDCs is that while each token\u2019s value may be fungible (interchangeable) with other tokens, each unit of the token is represented by an identifiable digital ID, similar to physical cash. Therefore, physical money such as notes or coins can be seen as a close comparison to CBDCs, but in a digital form. The designs of CBDCs aim to emulate the features of physical cash, such as handing over a banknote or coin, while also serving as a versatile tool that can be more than just a digital version of a nation\u2019s currency, satisfying numerous policy objectives [13], [39].\n\nIII. CBDC: DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\nCentral banks are exploring CBDCs for various reasons, including the modernization of the payment system and the desire to retain control over the financial system.\n\nA. Technological Advancement\n\nCentral banks aim to remain relevant amidst evolving con- sumer preferences driven by technological advancements [6], [27]. Developing CBDCs is viewed as a means to modernize the payment system and align with technological progress [26]. This could enhance transaction efficiency, reduce costs, and potentially improve financial inclusion by expanding access to banking services for those without traditional accounts [21]. However, the effectiveness of CBDCs, particularly the digital token concept, is contingent upon the technological advance- ment of a country\u2019s payment infrastructure.\n\nB. Financial Control\n\nThe emergence of digital currencies like Bitcoin and stable- coins have prompted central banks to consider creating their own CBDCs, aiming to remain relevant and competitive in the global financial landscape. There\u2019s concern that widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could weaken central banks\u2019 con- trol over the monetary system and potentially lead to financial instability [3], [38]. As cryptocurrencies gain traction, there\u2019s a risk of declining public trust in traditional fiat currencies issued by central banks [25]. Central banks are exploring CBDCs to address these challenges and to keep up with private- sector alternatives, aiming to maintain their influence over the economy amidst the possibility of widespread adoption of private digital currencies.\n\nC. Monetary Control\n\nUnlike cryptocurrency, which operates on decentralized networks, CBDCs are typically centralized, allowing direct government oversight of the monetary supply [1]. This central- ized control enhances the effectiveness of monetary policies, such as inflation control or stimulating economic growth. Additionally, CBDCs offer real-time transaction data, aiding in combating money laundering and illicit financial activities. While this boosts transparency, it raises privacy concerns as governments could closely monitor individual transactions. Increased control via CBDCs is viewed by some as a tool for financial stability, sparking a debate on the balance between state control and individual privacy.\n\nD. Privacy\n\nThe existing digital financial system already monitors users\u2019 financial activities, ensuring data protection and privacy under relevant laws [4]. If these same institutions adopt CBDC, existing privacy measures and regulations could apply to it as well. Thus, CBDC would face similar considerations to other digital payment services, balancing transactions, privacy, and data protection, particularly anti-money laundering and tax legislation. 1) Privacy Model for a CBDC : Privacy may vary based on the mode of payment such as online and offline. Low-value offline payments can provide a level of privacy equivalent to cash transactions, where users may not need to share transaction data. Online CBDC payments should take privacy, data protection, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and CFT (Counter the Financing of Terrorism) rules into account to ensure conformity with other relevant legislation that is already applicable to electronic payments.\n\nE. Centralised Control\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of permissionless blockchain and a fundamental feature of cryptocurrency. Re- search suggests opting for a permissioned blockchain when deciding between permissioned and permissionless architec- tures for CBDC [30], [43], [44], [47]. In practice, CBDCs may operate on a permissioned ledger governed by central authori- ties, exclusively accessible to designated financial institutions meeting specific requirements.\n\nIV. CBDC: DESIGN CHALLENGES\n\nDeveloping and implementing CBDCs pose various chal- lenges. Some of the key challenges are discussed below:\n\nA. Platform\n\nThe financial system\u2019s current architecture is two-tiered, with central banks governing money and commercial banks managing consumer-facing activities [10], [20]. Trust in cen- tral banks safeguards money\u2019s value and stabilizes inflation. Given that commercial banks manage retail payments, the key question is How the functional architecture of CBDC to be a direct claims on central bank works?\n\nWe like to emphasize the relationship between central and commercial banks in implementing CBDC services. Currently, two types of CBDC are discussed: retail and wholesale [26], [29]. The central bank is the sole issuer of CBDC, distributing wholesale CBDC to commercial banks for settling transac- tions between them or payment service providers. Consumers cannot directly access wholesale CBDC; instead, commercial banks issue retail CBDC to their customers. Studies have explored wholesale CBDC\u2019s potential to improve liquidity and serve as a payment method in financial markets [24]. Early discussions suggested central banks would manage all aspects, but involvement of commercial banks, particularly in customer-facing roles with retail CBDC, evolved over time. The objective of this retail CBDC is to fulfill the payment requirements of both households and businesses. Depending on its final design, the CBDC may facilitate or restrict payments beyond the conventional financial sector [31]. De- pending on the design, CBDC models might even allow for offline transactions, replicating the ability to exchange physical cash without an internet connection. Like physical cash, CBDCs would be recognized by the government as legal tender. However, they would also exist in digital form and be subject to various technological requirements, security measures, and potential regulatory controls that differ from those applying to physical cash. Thus, while CBDCs often aim to replicate some features of physical cash, they also introduce new characteristics and capabilities that reflect their digital nature and the specific policy goals of the central banks issuing them.\n\nB. Interoperability\n\nThe assumption is that CBDCs will not entirely replace existing digital money systems. Instead, both digital money and CBDCs will exist simultaneously [11]. This is important because the integration of digital money systems into various business processes is already widespread. Introducing CBDCs into this landscape could potentially disrupt the current finan- cial ecosystem, particularly those relying on intermediaries\u2019 services. For the effective coexistence of digital money and CBDCs to coexist effectively, it is essential to ensure interoperability between the CBDC system and the existing financial systems. This means that the CBDCs should be designed in a way that allows seamless integration with the current infrastructure, en- abling smooth transactions and compatibility with the services provided by intermediaries.\n\nC. Platform & Regulatory Compliance\n\nLet us assume, with CBDC, to keep the operational burden of the central bank, the private sector play an essential role in all customer-facing activities, just as in today\u2019s financial system. Private sector will provide the network services and central banks manage the minting operations, define smart contracts, and establish policies related to settlement, privacy, and data management. Network providers provide the infras- tructure for running the network servers on behalf of the\n\ncentral bank. Participating regulated entities, such as banks, handle account balances, account control, and the distribution of CBDCs. They are also responsible for KYC, AML and CFT compliance. Account information service and payment information service providers are involved in the retail side of CBDCs, ensuring offline and online storage of transactions and facilitating instant and immediate payment systems. The design of CBDC systems needs to consider a balance between preserving privacy and avoiding excessive surveil- lance, while simultaneously ensuring robust security measures and complying with regulatory requirements. Since CBDCs must coexist with existing systems, such as traditional banking systems, it is necessary to determine the level of integration and interaction between them. Standards also play a significant role in establishing framework for compatibility, efficiency, and ease of use across different CBDC systems, enabling seamless interactions and transactions across different coun- tries or entities.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThough CBDCs aim to replace the fiat currency, there are no successful implementations that derive all the properties of the fiat currency. Directly issuing CBDCs to retail customers and the role of commercial banks in this process have yet to be ascertained. The central bank being at the helm of each CBDC transaction, there is a risk of potential surveil- lance infrastructure emerging if the privacy concerns are not adequately addressed in the design of CBDC implementa- tion. Design considerations like restricted layered-view of the transaction ledger will allow a masked view of transaction attributes/metadata to the subjects who have authorization to access the attributes at that authorization level. At the default, lowermost layer shows only the presence of a transaction. Major central banks worldwide are conducting various CBDC pilots with varying degrees of success. Despite un- certainty regarding the retail utility of CBDCs compared to current digital wallet-based fiat currency interfaces, they offer significant benefits in the wholesale financial system.\n\nVI.

        "abstract": "In 2016, BitMEX introduced a novel type of crypto derivates -- Perpetual Swaps, i.e., futures with an infinite term.  Perpetual swaps provide a new strategic risk management tool for cryptocurrencies due to their custody-free nature, high leverage, and funding mechanism, but there has been little quantitative analysis on the their benefits. In this paper, we introduce a trading strategy that combines a Quanto Perpetual Swap with a spot position to benefit from the funding mechanism. We compare our strategy with a long-only investment in the underlying cryptocurrency and a similar strategy based on Linear Perpetual Swaps to evaluate their performances in a large-scale backtest covering the years 2021 and 2022. Our analysis shows that our strategy generates positive returns in bullish market phases of the underlying with lower volatility.",

                "This paper examines portfolio optimization in cryptocurrency exchanges utilizing perpetual swaps derivatives. Specifically, it explores the feasibility of combining long positions in crypto assets with derivative positions on the BitMEX exchange, focusing on two types of perpetual swaps: linear and quantum. The paper claims that such combinations can facilitate the creation of a market-neutral portfolio, which, in turn, would generate returns from funding rates. However, the results presented do not align with the claims made.",
                "A very interesting paper relating to an under researched area of perpetual swaps in the cryptocurrency space. I do not think I have seen anything like this before. The paper is simple and clear, and shows that the proposed Quanto strategy outperforms a lienar strategy.",
                "This paper provides a detailed explanation of the BitMEX perpetual swap, which has received relatively little analysis, and proposes a trading strategy utilizing it. Additionally, the strategy was validated by backtesting with historical data spanning a broad period of two years."
            ],
            "shortcoming": [
                "For linear perpetual swaps, the paper suggests portfolios comprise equal-sized long and short positions. Theoretically, the difference in funding rates should always be negative when considering a single exchange, as the difference compensates for liquidity risks. This is why the strategies involving linear perpetual swaps, as described in the article, result in losses. On the other hand, strategies incorporating quantum perpetual swaps show profitability. It seems plausible, however, that this profitability is not derived from funding rates but rather from the fact that the profit and loss (P&L) of these derivatives are denominated not in the base asset (i.e., USD) but in Bitcoin. Consequently, if Bitcoin's value surged, the portfolio, which was not delta-neutral relative to Bitcoin, would significantly increase in value, and vice versa.",
                "The results indicate that the Quanto strategy is able to generate very large gains in 2021 but leads to very large losses in 2022 - does this hinder its applicability in practice? Also, it appears that returns under a bullish market increase with the level of investment, but losses under a bearish market are similar across all investment levels - is there a particular reason for this phenomenon?

Perpetual swaps provide a new strategic risk management tool for cryptocurrencies due to their custody-free nature, high leverage, and funding mechanism, but there has been little quantitative analysis on the their benefits. In this paper, we introduce a trading strategy that combines a Quanto Perpetual Swap with a spot position to benefit from the funding mechanism. We compare our strategy with a long-only investment in the underlying cryptocurrency and a similar strategy based on Linear Perpetual Swaps to evaluate their performances in a large-scale backtest covering the years 2021 and 2022. Our analysis shows that our strategy generates positive returns in bullish market phases of the underlying with lower volatility.\n\nIndex Terms \u2014Crypto Derivatives, Risk Management, Perpetual Swaps\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the launch of Bitcoin [1] in 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s volatile nature has led to speculating on or hedging against its future price movement, which contributed to the fast development of Bitcoin-related derivatives [2]. Starting with the offering of the first Bitcoin perpetual swap in May 2016 by the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) and the Bitcoin futures by Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in December 2017, a variety of crypto derivatives have emerged. BitMEX is among the most relevant exchanges for trading futures on cryptocurrencies. According to CoinMarketCap , it ranks among the top 10 exchanges based on multiple factors, including liquidity and normalized volume [3]. Since 2016, BitMEX has offered different types of perpetual swaps [4] with different payout profiles, amounting to daily trading volume of $100 billion (https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/XBTUSD). Those contracts enable market participants to engage in cryptocur- rencies without the need to worry about the custody of the underlying assets, thus opening up new opportunities for strategic portfolio management.\n\nA perpetual swap is similar to a traditional futures contract, but has two main significant differences [4]. Firstly, a perpetual swap never expires and is therefore never settled. Secondly, a\n\nperpetual swap underlies a funding mechanism , where funding is paid from the majority to the minority position, to prevent a deviation from the underlying securities price. One idea for a trading strategy is to sell perpetual swaps, i.e., opening a short position, and hedging them by a spot position in the underlying. Ideally, this would create a market-neutral position that collects the funding rates. However, examining the effectiveness of this idea requires a detailed simulation that considers fees resulting from the trading activity.\n\nIn this work, we present a trading strategy that allocates an investment amount in two positions \u2013 a short position on quanto perpetual swaps side and a long position on the underlying spot side \u2013 and adjusts both positions depending on the price of the underlying. In a backtest, covering the years 2021 and 2022, we compare our trading strategy with a long-only investment in the underlying and an analogous strategy using the simpler linear perpetual swaps. Our analysis shows that our strategy generates positive and negative returns in bullish and bearish market phases, but to a lesser extent than a long-only strategy. In addition, our strategy is associated with lower volatility.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nPrevious papers examined various aspects of Bitcoin derivatives. In the realm of Bitcoin futures, many of them, starting with [5], [6], focus on the Bitcoin spot and futures market relationship, i.e., price discovery, but no consensus is reached as to which leads which [7]\u2013[9]. [10] adds that unregulated derivatives have net spillover effects on spot market. Other papers investigate the impact of Bitcoin derivative introduction on the Bitcoin spot market [11], [12], the speculation on crypto and price prediction [13]\u2013[20], and the arbitrage opportunities [21]\u2013[24]. We also see analysis on the participants of Bitcoin futures trading or ownership concentration of the product [21], [25].\n\nOn Bitcoin perpetual swap (XBTUSD), holistic analysis on BitMEX products [26] conclude that BitMEX derivatives could be responsible for the sudden price jumps that are often observed in Bitcoin markets and that the platform attracts diverse traders, both novices and experts. However, there has been relatively little analysis on the mechanism of BitMEX perpetual swap. Furthermore the BitMEX website lacks detailed 979-8-3503-1019-1/23/$31.00 \u00a92024 IEEE\n\ndescriptions of their structure [2]. Of the research that exists in this vein, [27] shows the heteroskedasticity of funding rates and its causal relationship with the XBTUSD contract. Through mathematical modeling including stochastic calculus methods, [2] holistically studies the funding rate and index price characteristics, as well as the liquidation mechanism in relation to leverage. Cash flows from holding a perpetual swap position, a crucial factor in estimating the present value of a position, is not investigated either. [28] formulates a theoretical model for the intrinsic value evolution, followed by [2], which provides comprehensive documentation of the cash flows for holding a long position on XBTUSD, by considering the realized profit- and-loss (PNL).\n\nRegarding BitMEX perpetual swap trading strategies, [29] conduct dynamic delta hedging analysis to conclude that the smile-implied hedge ratios exceed Black-Scholes delta hedging, particularly when employing perpetual swaps as a hedging tool. After acknowledging the difficulty in pricing perpetual futures due to the volatile nature of the funding rate, [30] devised a market directional high-frequency trading algorithm through volatility and mean models, which is designed with GARCH- based models [31] and support vector machine [32].\n\nIII. PRELIMINARIES\n\nA. Derivative Markets\n\nFinancial markets can be separated into spot markets and derivatives markets [33], [34]. In the spot market, the contract for purchasing or selling a primary financial instrument, e.g., stocks, precious metals, or bonds, is fulfilled immediately after the contract is concluded, modulo a technical deadline. In contrast, in the derivatives market, the contract is fulfilled on a forward date. A derivative\u2019s price and payout profile always refer to one or more primary assets, the underlying securities, and is either settled by physical delivery of the underlying or by payment of an equivalent (cash settlement) [26]. The main reasons for using derivates are hedging open positions, reducing costs, or speculating on the underlying price movement. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the custody of the underlying asset is another primary reason for using derivates, and, for example after the collapse of FTX , a migration from spot markets to derivatives markets was observed [35].\n\nB. BitMEX\u2019s Perpetual Swaps\n\nBitMEX, founded in 2014, is among the most relevant crypto derivatives exchanges. BitMEX is unregulated, that is, the exchange is not registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) . Furthermore, all margin and settlement payments are made in Bitcoin and no fiat currency is involved [10], [25]. In May 2016, BitMEX launched a new crypto derivate called perpetual swaps, futures with no expiry dates, backed by funding mechanism. There exist three products: Inverse , Linear and Quanto swaps. After the launch of perpetual swap by\n\nTABLEI CONTRACT INFORMATION ONB ITMEX QUANTO PERPETUAL SWAP\n\nVariable Description\n\nExample symbol ETHUSDUnderlying ETHUSDMultiplier 0.000 001 XBTMargin requirement 1 % Quote Currency USDSettlement Currency XBTMargin & PNLCurrency XBTTrading hours Every Day Expiry date None Funding Interval Every 8 hours\n\nBitMEX, other exchanges such as Bybit , OKEx , Binance , FTX , and Huobi released their perpetual swap products [36]. Perpetual swaps differ from Bitcoin futures in terms of the denomination, settlement mechanism, high leverage, regulation, and accessibility to US citizens [25].\n\nIn the following, we present the mathematical formulation underlying BitMEX\u2019s quanto perpetual swap with Ethereum as underlying (ETHUSD). However, the formulas can be applied to other underlying securities as well. The specifications of the contract are summarized in Table I including the multiplier and a maximum leverage (margin requirement). The payout profile of an ETHUSD contract depends on the movement of an index, which measures the price of Ethereum, and is determined by the multiplier. The multiplier specifies the amount of profit (long) or loss (short) when the index rises by one USD. The leverage determines how much margin in Bitcoin must be deposited as collateral when a position is opened. Consider n contracts are opened at t = 0 at the spot price Ethereum ETH t =0 , then the amount of margin is given by\n\nmargin = | n | \u00b7 ETH t =0 \u00b7 multiplier\n\nleverage [ BTC ] , (1)\n\nwhere n > 0 if contracts are bought (long) and n < 0 if contracts are sold (short). No additional margin will be deposited as long as the underlying does not exceed the liquidation price. Besides the margin and the size n , each position is specified by an entry price, a value, and a liquidation price. When opening a position, the entry price is given by the spot price of the underlying, i.e.,\n\nentry price t =0 = ETH t =0 [ USD ] . (2)\n\nThe value of the entire position at time t is independent of the leverage and only depends on the number of contracts n and the entry price. It is given by\n\nvalue = n \u00b7 multiplier \u00b7 entry price t [ BTC ] . (3)\n\nFurthermore, the liquidation price for a short position is determined by\n\nliquidation price t = entry price t \u00b7 \u0010 1 + leverage \u2212 1 \u0011 [ USD ] (4)\n\nFig. 1. Return on Investment and Sharpe Ratio for 2021.\n\nAs only one position can be held for the XBTUSD contract, the entry price changes when new positions are opened. Consider m additional positions are opened at t = 1 , then the weighted average gives the adjusted entry price for the n + m contracts, i.e.,\n\nentry price t =1 = n \u00b7 entry price t =0 + m \u00b7 spot t =1\n\nn + m . (5)\n\nAs Perpetual Swaps are derivates, their PNL depends on the price movement of the underlying. At time t , the Profit-and- Loss (PNL) is given by\n\nPNL t = n \u00b7 multiplier \u00b7 \u0010 ETH t \u2212 entry price t \u0011 [ BTC ] , (6)\n\ni.e., in case of negative n , the PNL is positive when the spot price is smaller than the entry price. The price development in USD depends not only on the price development of Ethereum but also on the development of Bitcoin. To link the development of the PNL as closely as possible to the development of the underlying asset, BitMEX introduced a funding mechanism. The underlying funding rates are determined every 8 hours and paid/deducted to the holder of a contract and the counterparty. When the funding rate is positive, longs pay shorts. When it is negative, shorts pay longs. The amount of funding at time t from the perspective of a short holder is given by\n\nfunding t = funding rate t \u00b7 value t [ BTC ] . (7)\n\nIV. STRATEGY\n\nOur investment strategy is implemented in two phases: opening and adjustment. When opening a position, given an investment amount V in USD, half of it is invested in a Ethereum spot position at time t = 0 , i.e.,\n\nn spot , 0 = V\n\n2 \u00b7 ETH 0 (8)\n\ncoins are bought. Simultaneously, perpetual swaps are sold with an value of 0 . 5 \u00b7 V . This requires\n\nn swap , 0 = V\n\n2 \u00b7 ETH 0 \u00b7 multiplier \u00b7 BTC 0 (9)\n\nshort positions to be opened.\n\nThe positions are adjusted at time t if the difference | PNL swap, t \u2212 PNL spot, t | exceeds a predefined threshold. If PNL spot, t > PNL swap, t , the spot position is reduced by the number of coins of value 0 . 5 \u00b7 ( PNL spot, t \u2212 PNL swap, t ) , and perpetual contracts are sold so that the value of the swap position rises by this amount. In the other case, contracts are closed and more coins of the underlying are bought. After the adjustment, both positions are weighted equally again, and a perfect hedge exists, i.e., we have the same situation as in the opening phase.\n\nV. BACKTEST\n\nWe compare our trading strategy with the analogous version based on linear perpetual swaps. We evaluate their performances using the Return on Investment (ROI) , given by\n\nROI = V 1 \u2212 V 0\n\nV 0 (10)\n\nwhere V 0 is the value of the portfolio at the beginning and V 1 is the value of the portfolio at the end. We further calculate the Sharpe Ratio (SR) to incorporate volatility, which is given by\n\nSR = V 1 \u2212 V 0\n\nV 0 \u00b7 \u03c3 , (11)\n\nwhereby we assume a risk-free interest rate of 0.00 % and \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of the positions excess returns [37]. The backtest covers the years 2021 and 2022. Figure 1 shows the net returns, i.e., returns less trading fees, for 2021, and Figure 2 the results for the year 2022. The BitMEX pricing model is based on\n\nFig. 2. Return on Investment and Sharpe Ratio for 2022.\n\nthe trading volume, and we always assume taker orders (https://www.bitmex.com/wallet/fees/derivatives). The reference prices for Ethereum and Bitcoin are derived as the mean of best ask and best bid from order books of Binance, the most liquid spot market, collected via the Hephaistos system presented by Henker et al. [38]; the funding rates are publicly available from BitMEX (https://www.bitmex.com/app/fundingHistory). Our data, implementation, and result files are available as a GitHub (https://github.com/atzberger/Hedging Quanto Perpetual Swaps) repository to guarantee reproducibility.\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum had a return of ROI = 413.5 % (SR = 3.79). The implementation of the strategy based on the linear perpetual swap generated a negative ROI in the same period, whereas the strategy based on the quanto perpetual swap generated a positive ROI. Of particular relevance here is the selected threshold \u03b8 = ( | PNL swap, t \u2212 PNL spot, t | ) /V , above which adjustments are made. The lower the threshold selected, the higher the ROI and the higher the SR. With a fixed threshold, both the ROI and the SR remained constant regardless of the investment volume. In 2022, Ethereum had a negative return of ROI = \u2212 57.3 % (SR = -0.77). Both strategies also show a negative ROI, independent of the investment amount at a constant threshold, which is not a surprise as the funding rates changed sign due to the market environment. Unlike in 2021, however, a lower value for \u03b8 harms both the ROI and the SR.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nOur results can be summarized as follows: by hedging a quanto perpetual swap, a strategy that achieves positive (negative) returns in bullish (bearish) market phases, but to a lesser extent than a long-only strategy, can be implemented. Furthermore, the SR shows that our strategy has a lower volatility. Therefore, our strategy represents an opportunity to participate in the performance of the underlying, but with a lower risk.\n\nOur results are prone to different threats to validity. Though our analysis incorporates trading fees as \u201cexplicit costs\u201d that reduce\n\nthe return, so-called \u201cimplicit costs\u201d are neglected. Implicit costs mean deviations from the assumed price of the underlying that arise from the order book [39]. Those implicit costs can rise dramatically, especially in \u201cextreme\u201d market scenarios, e.g., significant events [40]. However, this effect mainly depends on the order size, and as we recommend using a small threshold, the overall trend should not change [41]. Furthermore, funding rates might change by participating in the market, especially when placing large volumes. Our analysis relies on historical data, so this effect can not be incorporated.\n\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nDerivatives on cryptocurrencies enable market participants to manage their risk and speculate on price movements. BitMEX\u2019s perpetual swaps are among the most popular products in the crypto domain, as they never expire, require a low margin, and do not require fiat currencies. Furthermore, by introducing a funding mechanism, the contracts trade close to the underlying. We proposed a trading strategy that combines a short position of quanto perpetual swap and a spot position in the underlying and evaluated its performance in a backtest covering 2021 and 2022. Our results revealed that this strategy allows traders to participate in the price movement of the underlying but with lower volatility, thus lower risk. We presume that our strategy allows for diversification in the current changing market environment, as short positions receive funding.\n\nWe see different directions for future work: First, we plan to address the threats to validity by considering entire order books in our backtest to incorporate implicit costs, which requires a more performant implementation. Secondly, we see great potential in combining our strategy with a market-making algorithm to generate another income stream, as maker orders are rewarded in contrast to taker fees. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to analyze the ROI and SR in terms of other cryptocurrencies instead of USD.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Satoshi Nakamoto.

This switch from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is being done for several reasons. Firstly, PoS is more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than PoW [2]. It also allows for faster transaction processing and improved scalability. PoS allows for more decentralized decision- making, as the power to validate transactions is distributed among multiple \u201dmining\u201d nodes rather than concentrated in a few large mining pools [3]. To ensure correct protocol mechanisms, asset staking was invented. Staking refers to holding and committing assets as collateral to participate in the validation of transactions and the production of new blocks. Stakers, also known as validators, are producing new blocks for blockchain. If a validator produces a valid block, they are rewarded with a portion of the transaction fees and a block reward. However, if they produce an invalid block, they may be penalized, and their staked assets may be slashed. Yet, staking has a few problems, and in addition to discussing and speculating about its decentralization or securing, one of them is the illiquidity of staked assets and the impossibility of changing their owner. The inability to change the owner of staked assets can be very inconvenient, for example, if we urgently need to exchange our current staked collateral for other assets. This paper closely looks at this problem, analyzes the existing solutions, and describes a new concept that introduces the staking assets through an NFT account (NFTAA), i.e., transferring the ownership of the stake to the NFT account, which allows changing the owner of the stake (through a change of ownership of the NFTAA) in case that we need. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, a closer look at the example of Ethereum and its technical specifications is provided. Existing related works are analyzed in Section III. Next, the solution is presented in the form of NFT proxy accounts described in Section IV, and our evaluation is described in Section V. We summarize the paper, the discussion, and future work in Section VI.\n\nII. ETHEREUM INTRODUCTION\n\nEthereum stands tall as the unrivaled titan in the realm of smart contract platforms, commanding its position as the foremost and most sophisticated hub for decentralized financial ecosystems across the globe. This pioneering blockchain network is purpose-built to facilitate the seamless operation of decentralized applications (dApps) while steadfastly pursuing continuous enhancements in scalability, an on- going mission undertaken by its vibrant community of developers and stakeholders. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to scalability underscores its unwavering dedication to delivering a future-proof infrastructure that can efficiently accommodate the ever-expanding demands of the decentralized world. Through its tireless innovation, Ethereum endeavors to remain the largest, most adaptable, and responsive smart contract platform, serving as the bedrock of the decentralized digital economy.\n\nA. Proof of stake\n\nIn proof of stake (PoS), compared to proof of work (PoW) used in Bitcoin, we do not have miners but rather validators. Validators are nodes that validate blocks and their data, such as transactions. Validators are not competing to find the correct hash for a block and do not receive a reward in the form of a coinbase transaction as miners in Bitcoin. Instead, validators receive a reward through transaction fees from the transactions included in the block they validate. Having a lot of computing power to be a validator is unnecessary, and the process is less energy-intensive [4]. Validators are motivated to refrain from cheating because they must stake a certain amount of coins to become validators. These staked coins are used to secure the network and safeguard against cheating. If a validator is caught cheating, they lose their staked coins and can no longer serve as a validator. Since the reward for validating a block is typically less than the amount of staked coins, it is not financially worthwhile for a validator to cheat. In Ethereum, the amount of staked coins required to become a validator is set at 32 ETH [5]. Staking this amount is quick; however, unstaking is slightly different and can take days; recently, it was more than five days [6]. Therefore, selling the account with staked 32 ETH is quicker and gives users easy and fast access to money. However, you do not want to sell your original account because you could have history and other liquidity associated with it. Thus, we are introducing staking through an NFT which works as a proxy and isolates your stake, so you can easily sell it to anyone without risk of selling more than your stake.\n\nIII. RELATED WORKAND BACKGROUND\n\nAs mentioned, proof-of-stake can provide security for the network by other participants. As a bonus, there is also gaining of some profit from the staking. However, PoS has some drawbacks. First, to unstake the tokens, there is a need to wait for the withdrawal period.\n\nThe current withdrawal mechanism for validators has shown sig- nificant scalability concerns as the network grows. At present, the system only accommodates 16 withdrawals within a single block. This translates to a maximum processing capability of 115,200 validator withdrawals daily under the ideal scenario of no missed slots. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in light of rising validator numbers: 800,000 withdrawals take an entire week to process. This rigid structure poses a severe challenge as it correlates the number of validators with the withdrawal processing time. Moreover, the inherent risk of missed slots further complicates the landscape. While the system is designed to bypass validators without eligible withdrawals, thereby potentially saving some time, the downside of missed slots has a pronounced effect. Each missed slot can lead to a proportional delay in processing, pushing the timeline even further. Such inefficiencies can negatively impact user experience, potentially dissuading prospective validators from participating and undermining the very foundation of the network\u2019s decentralization principle. This bottleneck, if not addressed, threatens both the operational efficacy and the perceived reliability of the platform. Fortunately, already existing solutions can help solve these prob- lems. Generally speaking, there is a familiar concept: Lock ETHs and get a token representing the staked amount (derivate). Getting derivate from the staked asset is also called liquid staking. It represents the idea of making locked assets liquid. A liquid asset represents an asset that can be converted to cash. In DeFi terms, liquid assets can be swapped for other assets, such as stablecoins, or provide additional liquidity on the various decentralized exchanges.\n\nA. Liquid Staking Protocols\n\nLiquid staking providers empower you to tap into the liquidity of your staked assets. In return, these providers typically claim a share of the staking rewards ranging from 5% to 10% as compensation for rendering this valuable service. With the Shanghai upgrade, the appeal of Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) is set to soar, as it alleviates the inherent risks and inconveniences associated with conventional ETH staking. This surge in LSD adoption translates into amplified revenue streams for liquid staking platforms, instilling a bullish sentiment across the liquid staking sector. Anticipating this upward trajectory, MetaMask has thoughtfully integrated staking directly into its wallet interface, streamlining the process for users to stake their ETH. Users can look forward to earning approximately 5% annual rewards in ETH by leveraging this feature, with support currently extended to Lido and Rocket Pool and the possibility of more integrations in the pipeline [7].\n\nB. Lido\n\nLido made its mark as a trailblazer in the field of liquid staking. In 2020, with the launch of Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain, Lido became the first provider to offer liquid staking services, pioneering and popularizing this innovative approach. Since its inception, Lido has consistently maintained its position as a market leader. Lido\u2019s liquid staking solution revolves around its token known as stETH, which represents users\u2019 staked Ethereum (ETH). The process is simple: users deposit their ETH on Lido\u2019s staking platform and receive stETH in return. This transformative token empowers users by preserving the liquidity of their staked assets. With stETH in hand, users can explore a myriad of DeFi opportunities. Holders of stETH can choose to engage in various DeFi activities, including trading, lending, providing liquidity, and using it as collateral. Additionally,\n\nstETH holders earn ETH staking rewards in the form of more stETH tokens, further enhancing their potential yield. Lido operates on a sustainable revenue model. The platform collects a 10% fee from the ETH staking rewards generated. This fee is divided between Lido\u2019s node operators, who ensure the network\u2019s security, and the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) treasury. Despite its outstanding achievements, Lido\u2019s dominant position has raised concerns within the Ethereum community. Concentrating a substantial amount of Ether within a single organization poses potential risks to the network. A centralized attack on the Ethereum network could become feasible if Lido\u2019s control surpasses 33%. This scenario, known as a 1/3 centralization attack, is a recognized challenge in Proof-of-Stake ecosystems. In response, Lido and the Ethereum community are actively exploring avenues to enhance the decentralization of the protocol, mitigating these potential risks [7, 8].\n\nC. Rocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is a groundbreaking Ethereum PoS protocol designed to be community-owned, decentralized, trustless, and compatible with Ethereum\u2019s staking system. The project was conceived in late 2016 and has been live since October 2021. Rocket Pool caters to two primary user groups:\n\n\u2022 Tokenized Stakers: Individuals who want to participate in Ethereum staking using rETH with deposits as low as 0.01 ETH.\n\n\u2022 Node Operators: Users who stake ETH and run a node in the Rocket Pool network to earn higher returns compared to staking independently outside the protocol. This includes experienced users and those who may not have 32 ETH for solo staking. The core premise of Rocket Pool is to ensure the network remains decentralized, aligning with Ethereum\u2019s ethos and promoting self- sovereignty. Rocket Pool comprises several key components that create a decentralized Ethereum staking ecosystem. Smart con- tracts facilitate ETH deposits, allocate them to node operators based on demand, and manage various tokens and rewards. Rocket Pool\u2019s decentralized network of specialized Ethereum nodes runs the Smart Node software. These nodes communicate with the protocol\u2019s smart contracts and provide the network consensus required by the Ethereum Beacon Chain. Minipool validators are smart contracts created by node operators who deposit 8 or 16 ETH on their node. When the total ETH in a Minipool validator reaches 32 ETH, a new validator is created to perform consensus duties. Rocket Pool\u2019s commitment to decentralization, security, and inclu- sivity makes it an attractive solution for those looking to participate in Ethereum staking without the traditional barriers associated with solo staking. The decentralized protocol ensures resilience, scalability, and more equitable distribution of rewards within the network [7, 9].\n\nD. EIP-6551\n\nThe world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is on the brink of a significant transformation with the introduction of the ERC-6551 token standard. This new standard seeks to enhance the functionality of NFTs by equipping them with smart contract capabilities, allowing them to represent unique digital assets and act as smart contract wallets. The ERC-721 standard, the foundation for creating unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain, has its limitations. While it paved the way for myriad applications, from art to virtual real estate, its scope is restricted. NFTs based on ERC-721 can only be owned and transferred; they cannot own other assets or interact dynamically with other smart contracts. Proposed as an Ethereum Improvement\n\nProposal (EIP) in February 2023, ERC-6551 aims to address these limitations. It introduces a system where every NFT can be assigned an Ethereum account, termed a token-bound account (TBA). This account enables the NFT to own assets, interact with applications, and execute arbitrary operations, all without necessitating changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure. Key features:\n\n\u2022 Smart Contract Capabilities: Beyond representing unique assets, ERC-6551 tokens can function as smart contract wallets, holding other tokens and NFTs.\n\n\u2022 Interactivity: TBAs can seamlessly interact with various entities on the Ethereum network, from decentralized exchanges to gaming platforms.\n\n\u2022 Composability: This feature allows NFTs to bundle with related assets, enhancing user experiences, especially in Web3 gaming environments.\n\n\u2022 Identity & Provenance: Each NFT, with its distinct identity, can interact independently with decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, users can trace the complete transaction history of an asset, offering a clearer picture of its past interactions and uses. The ERC-6551 standard represents a pivotal moment in the evolu- tion of NFTs. Bridging the gap between unique digital assets and smart contract functionality opens up a realm of possibilities in the Web3 space, from gaming to art and beyond. As the crypto community navigates its challenges, the potential of ERC-6551 to redefine digital ownership remains immense [10, 11, 12]. But this solution also has some gaps. Firstly, the existence of TBA is not documented in the NFT, meaning we could possess an NFT without any knowledge of an associated account until we check the TBA register. We can also sell an NFT with possession of different assets by mistake and thus lose our precious liquidity. The second major gap is the lack of atomicity in the creation process. Of course, this is because TBA applies to all existing NFTs. Still, we think that creating an NFT and wallet in one atomic transaction, ensuring that the NFT is fully bound to the wallet proxy contract from its inception and that the NFT has information about its connection to the wallet contract, is more transparent.\n\nIV. SOLUTION DESIGN\n\nIn the case of the existing solutions (except ERC-6551), the ETH collateral is often protected via a DAO / multi-signature account. However, this means that the security of the assets is not directly in the hands of the user because, in case of a problem or a third-party devaluation, our liquid assets representing our stake are depreciated. This section delves into the cutting-edge notion of staking via NFTs, which serve as distinct accounts within the system. Although this method is not yet common, we bring a few insights into why it is a good idea. As we see it as a non-standard idea, the novelty of our work lies in exploring its potential, while considering this rarity not as a weakness, but as an opportunity to innovate in the field of blockchain applications. The term \u201dnon-fungible token\u201d refers to a unique and distinct asset that can represent various physical items with varying values. On the other hand, NFTs primarily operate on the asset side of the owner-asset relationship and lack the potential to own other assets. On the other hand, accounts are used to represent ownership of assets. In an owner-asset relationship, the account can be on the first or second side. After composing these two relations, it follows that it is possible for an account and an NFT to be represented by a single object that will be uniquely identifiable and will have the nature of an asset that can be owned - change its owner\n\nand at the same time can own other assets. We represent a non- fungible token as an account, NFTAA in short. Most Ethereum is based on a single account architecture consistent with the NFTAA philosophy and facilitates connection with existing infrastructure. We may easily exploit existing infrastructure for smooth communication if NFTAAs are handled as conventional accounts. Furthermore, if needed, NFTAAs can function as asset owners or in a multi-sig scheme. Another key characteristic of NFTAA is the ownership possibilities and the transferability of this ownership to any other account, potentially other NFTAAs. This means that the private keys used to alter a certain NFTAA will change. This is feasible thanks to the well-known proxy smart contracts [13, 14]. Figure 1 shows the relationships between NFTAA and other logical entities.\n\nFig. 1. NFT as an account interaction\n\nWe can create a proxy account (smart contract) to perform specific tasks on behalf of another account. For example, Bob\u2019s account can have a proxy account named Alice. Alice can send transactions on Bob\u2019s behalf, but only for the calls Bob has approved, as Bob is the only person currently authorized to access the proxy. This means that if Alice sends a transaction, it is initiated by Bob, so Bob appears to be signed by Bob, even though Alice is technically sending it.\n\nA. DeFi and DAO use cases\n\nWhen we discuss accounts, NFTs, assets, staking, ownership, and owners - DeFi comes into play, and because of the nature of NFTAA, we will also discuss DAO. As stated before, if we own ETH and decide on liquidity staking, we have staked the ETH in exchange for other assets we can continue utilizing. Compared to futures or tokens as a reward for staking, NFT may appear to be one large illiquid piece of value. This is not the case because fractionalizing NFT is not novel in the DeFi world [15]. The ideal number of fractions equals the number of ETH tokens staked on behalf of the NFTAA account. However, for whatever reason, we may be unable to fold NFTs distributed in this manner back to their original condition. We could remedy this by holding a buyout auction or depositing a sum greater than the reported staking value. We can still perform an unstake if our NFTAA becomes fully illiquid for any reason and cannot be sold on the secondary market or used as collateral for a loan, and after this, the NFTAA may (or may not) be burnt. Another intriguing application of NFTAA is the ability to manage an account using numerous proxy accounts, each with the capacity to make certain calls. This offers numerous benefits as we see it as a new paradigm for asset management and ownership in the ecosystem of decentralized finances. We can think of NFTAA as a company with employees who have specific roles. Specific subaccounts represent particular roles, but the company signs all transactions. From another point of view, NFTAA represents a company that can hold shares in\n\nFig. 2. NFTAASolidity sequence diagram\n\nthe form of investments and other liquid or unique assets. NFTAA, like any other corporation, can be acquired. The NFTAA also functions as the company\u2019s ledger. Last but not least, the big trend in the Ethereum ecosystem is re- staking liquid staking tokens (LRST), such as Lido and Rocket Pool mentioned in Section III as re-staked tokens serve as a security for data availability layers - mainly dominated by EigenLayer [16]. We open new possibilities and scientific contributions of LRSTs because the NFTs can give better portfolio control without emitting new tokens for re-staking.\n\nB. Architecture\n\nFigure 2 shows the key elements of the architecture. The foundation of the entire implementation is the NFTAA smart contract, which has ERC-721 as the underlying implementation. Subsequently, the NFT mining functionality is enriched by the creation of the NFTAA smart contract, which is interleaved from the NFT that has been mined. The NFTAA contract contains a proxy function that allows the owner of the pinned NFT to perform transactions through the NFTAA account. Listing 1 shows how we can modify a function to be successfully called only if the caller owns a bound NFT.\n\n1 modifier onlyNFTOwner() {\n\n2 require (\n\n3 msg . sender == ERC721(_binded_nft_addr).\n\nownerOf(_binded_nft_id),\n\n4 \"Caller is not the owner of the NFT\"\n\n5 );\n\n6 _;\n\n7 }\n\nListing 1. NFT owner only modifier\n\nWe created a web application that allows users to engage with the NFTAA manufacturing contract. The application is built on a template for developing web apps that interface with web3 applications [17]. This template is useful, but it only works with the Talisman wallet. Unfortunately, the Talisman documentation does not state if it allows signing EVM transactions [18, 19]. To alleviate this constraint, we have added Metamask wallet support. Finally, for ease of use, as we can see in Figure 3, we created a dApp using the NFTAA concept\n\nfor staking. Via this decentralized application, we can: Stake, Add other funds to the stake, Unstake, Get a balance of the stake, Get the staker address, Mint new NFTAA, Transfer ownership of NFTAA. NFTAA introduces a novel approach to account management. Each user is issued a unique NFT that can represent their account. This NFT can encode specific attributes, permissions, or properties related to the user, such as staking rights, access to certain functionalities, or governance privileges within a decentralized ecosystem. In particular, the use case of proxy-staking accounts leverages this NFT-based approach for staking mechanisms. Instead of the conventional method of staking tokens in a wallet, users stake their NFT-based accounts\u2019 tokens. The NFT encapsulates staking parameters, delegation prefer- ences, and other relevant details for participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. Through this model, the NFT serves as a representation of ownership and a means to determine the user\u2019s staking weight and influence within the network. The more tokens staked through a bound NFT account, the more significant the user\u2019s impact on consensus, rewards, and potentially, governance decisions. Furthermore, NFTAA can facilitate delegation strategies, allowing users to delegate their staking rights or influence to other accounts or entities while still maintaining ownership of their NFT-based account. This flexibility enhances the overall decentralization and participation in the network. This proposed framework does not emphasize the preservation of backward compatibility with existing NFT contracts, abstaining from alterations to the ERC-721 standard. However, it is theoretically possible to choose the standard to be used when creating NFTAA so that we could use ERC-165, but of course, we prefer to use ERC-721. Alternatively, a partial subset of the ERC-721 interface could be used (e.g., ENSNameWrapper names).\n\nC. NFTAA vs TBA\n\nAs highlighted in Section III-D, EIP 6551 presents certain limita- tions. Our solution, however, does not prioritize connecting existing NFTs but enables bidirectional binding of the NFT and Proxy contract. Consequently, upon ownership of an NFT, we can discern from the NFT metadata that it is associated with another smart contract, indicating its status as an NFTAA. Furthermore, we enhance\n\nFig. 3. NFTAA dApp\n\ntransparency by ensuring the atomic creation of the NFT and proxy contract within a single transaction, thereby promoting seamless integration. Likewise, our design does not need the registrar service to create the TBA address as opposed to TBA. In our case, the factory contract creates the NFTAA contract with functionality that also works as the NFTAA address (TBA uses one more address than NFTAA). Another difference is that in TBA, you could have more accounts on one NFT, which in our case is not possible due to the atomic creation of exactly one NFT at the time of creating the NFTAA smart contract (we first create the account contract and exactly after that the unique NFT). However, theoretically, we could use already existing NFTAA as the NFT in TBA :-). Regarding security, there are at least two differences between NFTAA and TBA. The first is the possibility of generating the address of TBA sooner without having the deployed contract (as the create2 function for creating contracts is deterministic, i.e., you can calculate the future contract address). In this case, if the upcoming smart contract is badly developed (does not contain an execute function for byte calls to other contracts) or is not upgradeable, it can happen that assets or liquidity sent to the TBA will not be withdrawable and become locked forever (even the NFT bounded in TBA can be sent by a mistake (if not safeguarded) to the address of TBA. Therefore you lock yourself from it). The problem is that TBA uses only the address of any contract you want in the registry contract and does not look for any details on how the contract looks or if it is already deployed. In our case, the account form is pre-defined in the factory contract, and even after deployment, we guarantee upgradeability as it is a proxy account. The second security issue is potential fraud, which is described in the EIP 6551 specification 1 that you withdraw assets from the TBA and at the same time sell the NFT to someone who fought that they will also have the assets in the TBA. In our case, we provide the security measures for not withdrawing the assets from the NFTAA while also selling the NFT, which is bound to the NFTAA smart contract. A small difference is also in the address where you receive the assets (unstake in the case of staking). In TBA, the unstaked amount will go to the TBA address; in NFTAA, the unstaked amount will go to the NFTAA smart contract address.\n\n1 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#fraud-prevention\n\nV. EVALUATION ANDTESTING\n\nWhen testing decentralized applications, the most important thing to focus on is the core functionality performed on the blockchain. The most significant part is the smart contract. Testing smart contracts is more complicated than testing regular software, but many tools make this easier nowadays. One of them is the Ethereum development environment Hardhat [20]. This development tool allows us to run the blockchain network locally and, among other things, provides extensive support for testing and mocking data to simulate a real blockchain environment. We provide the source codes on GitHub 2 .\n\nA. Smart contract testing\n\nBased on these functionalities, we built our tests documented in Figure 4. The tests were built to evaluate the key elements of our concept. To this end, the tests mainly focus on:\n\n\u2022 Flow test - determine whether the system can successfully mint a new NFTAA contract, emit a \u2019NewNFTAA\u2019 event, and check if the minted NFT is bonded.\n\n\u2022 Validations - the system ensures that transactions attempting to mint an NFTAA contract with an empty or excessively large description are correctly reverted.\n\n\u2022 Staking - ensures that users can stake their funds, increase their stakes, and unstake them. Additionally, it verifies that users cannot unstake before the system reaches the unlock time.\n\n\u2022 Attributes - the system\u2019s ability to return the proper bound NFTID and NFTAA note is tested in these tests.\n\n\u2022 Proxy - examine if the system correctly revokes actions taken by parties other than the contract owner and whether it issues a \u201dProxyResponse\u201d event whenever a legitimate function call performed via the proxy is received. Eleven subtests passed the testing phase. By running these auto- mated tests, we can ensure that the smart contract system performs as expected and adheres to our expectations.\n\nB. Requirements evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of requirements, as depicted in Table I, demon- strates the successful implementation of key features within the sys- tem. The initial requirement (Request 1.) ensuring users can connect their wallets has been met, establishing a fundamental connection\n\n2 https://github.com/fiit-ba/NFTAA\n\nFig. 4. Results of smart contracts testing\n\nbetween users and the platform. Subsequently, the creation of NF- TAAs (Non-Fungible Token Asset Accounts) is confirmed successful (Request 2.), emphasizing the system\u2019s capability to generate unique and distinct token accounts. Transactions are seamlessly facilitated with the successful transfer of NFTAAs between wallets (Request 3.), affirming the platform\u2019s robustness in handling asset transfers. Stakeholder engagement is supported through functionalities such as staking (Request 4.) and unstaking (Request 5.) via NFTAA, reflect- ing the system\u2019s commitment to user participation in blockchain- based activities. Moreover, users can conveniently monitor their NFTAAs (Request 6.), fostering transparency and awareness of individual token holdings. The system\u2019s ability to verify ownership of NFTAA (Request 7.) adds an additional layer of security and accountability. The rest of the requirements are non-functional. We did a thorough, smart contract security audit by tools Slither 3 and MythX 4 to evaluate non-functional requirement number fourteen. There were no critical or severe issues in the security model. As a result, the acceptance testing of the non-functional requirements is successful. The evaluation underscores the system\u2019s effective incorporation of essential functionalities, meeting or exceeding the specified requirements and providing users with a comprehensive and reliable blockchain experience.\n\nTABLEI EVALUATION OFREQUIREMENTS\n\nRequest identifier Description of the requirement Evaluation\n\n1.

CONCLUSION ANDFUTURE WORK\n\nNon-fungible tokens as accounts have massive potential in the Ethereum ecosystem. They can provide a valuable asset that can be used as an account in the runtime and traded on the market. One of the best features of the NFTAA system is that any account type can cooperate with NFTAA: externally owned accounts, smart contracts, proxies, or multi-signature accounts. Staking is an excellent use case example for NFTAA. Unlike classic liquid staking, NFTAA does not rely on any DAO, multi-signature accounts, or entity that manages the token; instead, the owners are in full custody of their assets. Additionally, the network does not lose any security since no funds are unstaked and can be withdrawn. Moreover, non-fungible tokens can be used in other DeFi applications, such as lending, borrowing, and derivatives, so they do not lose any flexibility. From the implementation perspective, the NFTAA can be implemented with current and available Solidity tooling. However, the applicability of NFTAA is not only in staking use case but also company owning, asset and portfolio management, delegation of rights to another wallet, DAO governance, or even identity and role management (e.g., you could have a game profile or persona linked to the NFT and in future sell it with every item in the itinerary). The possibilities of NFTAA are nearly endless. However, the key focus area of this research was the area of staking. We are opening new business opportunities with the new data availability layers and their re-staking mechanism. Our solution architecture is designed to be used with layer two so- lutions that are an alternative way of expanding Ethereum scalability. Our assessment shows feasibility and scale in the current Ethereum ecosystem, with a commitment to address scale concerns more in- depth in future revisions. In summary, non-fungible tokens as accounts, specifically in the context of proxy-staking or token-bound accounts, introduce a paradigm shift in account management and staking within blockchain ecosystems. Integrating unique NFTs with account functionalities enhances personalization, participation, and governance within de- centralized networks. It reflects the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, where innovative applications continually redefine the boundaries of traditional concepts. This paper offers design and architecture decisions with a simple implementation, which allows developers and researchers to choose the best solution for their needs. Future work includes examining other use cases for NFTAA and, most importantly, conducting a detailed security assessment to identify and mitigate potential risks. We know that staking through NFTAA reduces asset loss and network security risks compared to externally owned accounts. By decoupling the stake from the owner, we make staking delegation more effective because of the fact that NFTAA serves as a proxy for externally owned accounts. Moreover, we would like to observe the usage of NFTAA in different networks, e.g., the Polkadot ecosystem, where there is already an implementation of proxy accounts and the unstacking lasts 28 days. Implementing NFTAA in the Substrase environment means bringing this concept to a completely different technology. Also, the plan is to extend the research to more enterprise use cases with great potential for business and blockchain fusion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Contract no.

INTRODUCTION\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges nowadays constitute a multi- billion dollar industry with hundreds of competing platforms: As of January 2024, CoinMarketCap lists over 200 spot exchanges and approximately 450 decentralized exchanges 1 . This inevitably raises the question of how cryptocurrency exchanges operate and what they are being used for. Un- fortunately, there is only little research on cryptocurrency exchanges available that relies on direct empirical evidence. In a pioneering study using the APIs of ShapeShift, Yousaf et al. demonstrated that the interfaces of exchange platforms might inadvertently facilitate the cross-chain traceability of transactions. Their analysis identi\ufb01ed corresponding cryp- tocurrency transactions for 70% \u2212 90% of exchanges made on the platform over a 13 -month period [1]. In this study, we add fresh insights to the line of research started by [1]: We develop a new method for identifying exchange-related cryptocurrency transactions for the exchange platform Evonax 2 and perform an in-depth analysis of the acquired data. Our key contributions are as follows: We present a novel method for extracting cryptocurrency trade data from an exchange platform. By reverse-engineering the way Evonax handles payments on the blockchain, we obtain information that can be used to acquire trade data from an interface provided by Evonax. Employing this method, we compile a dataset containing detailed information on 30 , 402\n\n1 https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/ 2 https://www.evonax.com/\n\nexchange trades spanning from the platform\u2019s launch on February 16, 2018, to December 31, 2022. Additionally, we attain a deep understanding of Evonax\u2019s internal operations and investigate the behavior of its users. For instance, we identify a unique trading pattern involving intra-currency \u201ccoin swaps\u201d, and provide evidence of its use for obscuring the \ufb02ow of funds obtained from illicit activities. The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of related work. Technical background information is presented in Section III. Section IV outlines the methodology for acquiring Evonax trades using the blockchain and the Evonax track exchange form. Platform operations of Evonax are analyzed in Section V, and interesting use cases are discussed in Section VI. A critical discussion of our \ufb01ndings is presented in Section VII.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nNumerous studies explore the security and privacy aspects of cryptocurrencies, often employing address clustering heuris- tics. Such heuristics exist for UTXO-based currencies [2], as well as account-based ones [3]. Research also explores recurring transaction patterns from cryptocurrency services such as darknet markets [4] and exchanges [5]. Within the cryptocurrency exchange domain, studies, in- cluding those from non-computer science \ufb01elds, tend to concentrate on regulation [6], wash trading [7] and money laundering [8]. To our knowledge, [1] is the sole work investigating trading behavior on cryptocurrency exchanges using actual trading data from blockchain analysis and exchange APIs: Yousaf et al. leverage ShapeShift\u2019s API to derive trading information, identifying corresponding cryptocurrency transactions with success rates ranging from 70% to 90% of exchanges on the platform. They de\ufb01ne three cross-currency transaction patterns and conduct case studies to uncover potential criminal activities. Our study complements and expands [1] in several aspects. We delve into an exchange\u2019s internal payment processing mechanisms and corresponding blockchain transaction pat- terns, allowing us to extract a comprehensive dataset of nearly the entire trade history. Using this dataset, we investigate exceptional use cases, notably identifying a novel trading pat-\n\ntern termed \u201ccoin swaps\u201d and linking some trades to criminal activities.\n\nIII. BACKGROUND\n\nWe assume that readers are familiar with cryptocurrencies and provide a brief overview of our notation for key concepts only.\n\nA. Transactions\n\nFormally, a transaction t in currency C involves a set of input addresses A in t and output addresses A out t . A value v a exists for each a \u2208 A in t , denoting the amount spent in the transaction, and similarly for each a \u2208 A out t indicating the received amount. This paper primarily focuses on addresses, de\ufb01ning a transaction t by the parameters:\n\nt = ( C , A in t , A out t ) . (1)\n\nTransactions on the blockchain are uniquely identi\ufb01ed by their transaction ID (TXID). For simplicity, we use t to refer to both a transaction and its TXID.\n\nB. Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nIn our model, a cryptocurrency exchange facilitates the sale of a speci\ufb01ed amount v in of currency C in in exchange for an amount v out of currency C out , where at least one currency involved is a cryptocurrency. The received v out is determined by the exchange rate of the currency pair and an optional fee. We generically term this process an exchange trade e , even if C in = C out . To avoid confusion with the terms transaction and (exchange) trade , we clarify their usage: Transaction t refers to the concept of transactions in the context of cryptocurrencies (cf. Section III-A), while trade e describes the act of exchanging one cryptocurrency for another using a cryptocurrency exchange platform. 1) Structure of a Trade: Irrespective of their speci\ufb01c im- plementation, exchange platforms typically manage cryptocur- rency trading through three transactions: Pay-in transaction t in : Users initiate a transaction t in , transferring v in within currency C in from user address a u to an exchange-owned deposit address a dep . Deposit addresses are used to link payments to customers, especially for cryp- tocurrencies lacking reference \ufb01elds in their transaction data. Deposit transaction t dep : As user deposits are usually resold in other trades, accumulated funds in a dep are eventually withdrawn in an exchange-issued transaction t dep . Pay-out transaction t out : Upon con\ufb01rming the user\u2019s trans- fer of v in to a dep , the exchange initiates a pay-out transaction t out , transferring v out from an exchange-owned wallet to the user\u2019s payout address a out . In this study, we focus on transactions issued by the exchange service: t dep and t out . t in is user-initiated and not part of the trade. Thus, a trade e has the following parameters:\n\ne = ( C in , a dep , v in , t dep | {z } deposit transaction\n\n; C out , a out , v out , t out | {z } pay-out transaction\n\n) . (2)\n\nThe deposit transaction t dep and pay-out transaction t out are transactions in C in and C out , respectively. Notably, only \u201chalf\u201d of each transaction is involved in a given trade, signifying that for t dep , an input address a dep \u2208 A in t dep is known, and for t out , an output address a out \u2208 A out t out is known. Additionally, t dep may occur after t out , indicating that a user might receive their bought coins before their sold ones are swept off a dep .\n\nC. Evonax Evonax is a cryptocurrency exchange supporting the crypto- to-crypto exchange of nine native cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Dash, Dogecoin, Ether, Litecoin, Monero, ZCash) and nine ERC-20 tokens (0x, Chainlink, Compound, Dai, Maker, Shiba Inu, Tether, Uniswap, Wrapped Bitcoin). Initial support for Bitcoin SV was discontinued. The platform claims no registration or know-your-customer (KYC) checks are required for its use. Initially offering exchanges to and from \ufb01at currencies, Evonax allowed deposits via bank transfer and payouts through PayPal. After PayPal terminated its business relationship with Evonax, the service shifted to AdvCash as a payment provider [9]. Crypto-to-\ufb01at trades using AdvCash were also discontinued in February 2022. Trades on Evonax are initiated via a simple form on the website, with no need for user account creation. Users interested in the service \ufb01rst select C in and C out . Evonax then sets an exchange rate and prompts the user to specify either the amount to sell ( v in ) or the amount to buy ( v out ). Once one amount is entered, the other is automatically calculated based on the exchange rate. After providing a valid pay-out address a out in C out , the exchange can be started. Users may opt to supply an email address for status updates. Interestingly, users can choose the same currency for C in and C out . From a trading standpoint, this may seem futile, as the user incurs network and exchange fees but ends up with the same currency. Possible use cases are explored in Section VI-B. Evonax lacks an order book, advanced trading interface, or trading API. The website interface is the only way to initiate a trade.\n\nIV. DATA ACQUISITION Let E denote the complete set of all trades executed on Evonax. Our objective is to capture as many trades in E as possible, achieved through Extract procedures that extract ad- ditional trades from a given set of trades using the blockchain and the Evonax interface. More detailed descriptions of these procedures are provided below. The initial step is to identify a \u201cstarting\u201d set of trades, obtained from our own test trades and by extracting cryptocurrency addresses from user reviews on Trustpilot 3 . Subsequently, the Extract procedures are repeat- edly applied to the known set until no new trades are found. These procedures leverage two sources of information: the public blockchain and a web interface provided by Evonax. The blockchains of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin SV, Monero, and Zcash are excluded from the acquisition\n\n3 https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.evonax.com\n\nprocess due to low trading volume and/or privacy-centric design. However, information on trades involving these coins is still acquired as a byproduct, for instance, if the other involved currency is part of the analysis or the trade has a known email address associated with it. Blockchain: As the blockchain contains all transactions, it is possible to directly derive the input and output addresses of a given transaction t (cf. Equation (1)):\n\nt Blockchain 7\u2192 ( A in t , A out t ) (3)\n\nAdditionally, the blockchain can be searched for transactions where only partial information is known. More precisely, given an address a , one can extract all transactions t where a is either an input or output address:\n\na Blockchain 7\u2192 \b t | a \u2208 A in t\n\n(4)\n\na Blockchain 7\u2192 \b t | a \u2208 A out t\n\n(5)\n\nEvonax web interface: Evonax facilitates the querying of exchange transaction status through a track exchange form 4 . This page is publicly accessible, and requests are not authenti- cated. Trades are identi\ufb01ed by either the deposit address a dep , the pay-out address a out , or an (optionally provided) e-mail address @ mail . Entering any of these three identi\ufb01ers will prompt the web- site to display status information for all exchanges involving the speci\ufb01ed search key. The status data includes the TXIDs of the pay-in transaction t in and the pay-out transaction t out , the deposit address a dep , the pay-out address a out , a timestamp, the exchanged currencies C in and C out with the corresponding amounts and the exchange rate and, optionally, an e-mail address @ mail . In essence, the Evonax interface allows the use of partial trade information as input and provides nearly the full data about a trade (cf. Equation (2)) in return. Only t dep is not directly provided. However, as the deposit address a dep is trade-speci\ufb01c and under the control of Evonax, t dep can be reliably identi\ufb01ed with the help of the public blockchain and Procedure (4). To summarize, the Evonax track exchange form offers two procedures for deriving trade information:\n\n@ mail \u2217 Evonax 7\u2192 { ( e, @ mail ) | @ mail \u2217 = @ mail } (6)\n\na Evonax 7\u2192 { ( e, @ mail ) | a = a dep \u2228 a = a out } (7)\n\nProcedures (6) and (7) directly produce (potentially) new trades if @ mail , a dep or a out is provided. This allows us to derive all trades associated with a given e-mail, deposit or pay- out address. This approach is part of the Extract procedures for both account-based and UTXO-based currencies. The subsequent part of this section describes the Extract procedures for the case of account-based cryptocurrencies (Section IV-A) and UTXO-based cryptocurrencies (Sec- tion IV-B). Each procedure, applied to a trade as displayed\n\n4 https://www.evonax.com/status\n\nin Equation (2), identi\ufb01es (potentially) new trades. Note that each procedure can be applied to either t dep or t out , but not both. Thus, cases in which C in is an account-based currency and C out is a UTXO-based currency, and vice versa, can be handled by combining the appropriate procedures.\n\nA. Account-Based Cryptocurrencies Evonax employs a dedicated hot wallet with a single ad- dress 5 a hot for handling payments in account-based currencies. Trades involving at least one of C in and C out as an account- based currency or ERC-20 token trigger transactions involving the hot wallet. Users exchanging Ether on Evonax send funds to an exchange-owned deposit address a dep . After trade execution, Evonax initiates transaction t dep , forwarding funds from a dep to a hot . Similarly, when users exchange other currencies for Ether or an ERC-20 token, transaction t out transfers funds from a hot to the user-speci\ufb01ed pay-out address a out . For ERC-20 token deposits, additional transactions are required due to gas fees for t dep . Following the ERC-20 token deposit, a small amount of Ether is transferred from a hot to a dep to cover gas fees. Subsequently, t dep transfers the ERC- 20 tokens to a hot , utilizing the previously transferred Ether for gas fees. The remaining Ether is returned to a hot . Identifying t dep is possible as it is the sole transaction transferring tokens off a dep . The extraction procedures for trades involving Ether or an ERC-20 token are de\ufb01ned as follows: Approach 1: Pay-out transaction t out transfers funds from a hot to a out . Procedure (3) yields A in t out = { a hot } , the hot wallet address. Subsequently, approach 3 is applied. Approach 2: Deposit transaction t dep forwards deposited funds from a dep to a hot . If a dep is known, Procedure (4) retrieves t dep , and Procedure (3) yields A out t dep = { a hot } . Extraction then proceeds with approach 3 . Approach 3: With the hot wallet address a hot , trades can be retrieved in a two-step process. First, Procedure (5) is employed to query the blockchain for transactions transferring funds to the hot wallet:\n\na hot Blockchain 7\u2192 \b t | a hot \u2208 A out t =: T. (8)\n\nFor each transaction t \u2208 T , Procedure (3) provides A in t , the potential deposit addresses. To verify if an address a \u2208 A in t is a deposit address, the Evonax track exchange page is consulted: a is a deposit address if and only if Procedure (7) returns a trade when queried for the address. Otherwise, the address is \ufb02agged for further inspection. In the second step, transactions transferring funds from the hot wallet are obtained using Procedure (4):\n\na hot Blockchain 7\u2192 \b t | a hot \u2208 A in t =: T. (9)\n\nSimilarly, for each transaction t \u2208 T , Procedure (3) provides a potential pay-out address. True pay-out addresses in A out t are identi\ufb01ed through Evonax\u2019s track exchange page, while non- pay-out addresses are collected for further analysis.\n\n5 0x2ab5a95e5881ba190434bd2ca423f7f1e2106747\n\nB. UTXO-Based Cryptocurrencies\n\nSimilar to account-based currencies, new trades can be obtained using either the pay-out transaction t out or the deposit address a dep in the deposit transaction. Approach 1: The \ufb01rst approach leverages the fact that a trade speci\ufb01es a pay-out transaction t out . Procedure (3) identi\ufb01es the set of its input addresses A in t out and output addresses A out t out . Further trades can be derived from these sets. Notably, the same transactions can be involved in multiple trades. A transaction t out can serve as the pay-out transaction for several trades simultaneously. In other words, two distinct trades e \u0338 = e \u2032 may exist such that\n\ne = ( . . . ; C out , a out , v out , t out ) ,\n\ne \u2032 = ( . . . ; C out , a \u2032 out , v \u2032 out , t out ) .\n\nPay-out addresses of additional trades can be derived from the set A out t out using Procedure (3). Distinguishing pay-out addresses from other elements in A out t out , such as change addresses, is crucial. The Evonax interface serves this purpose: a \u2217 \u2208 A out t out is a pay-out address if and only if the Evonax interface returns a trade (cf. Procedure (7)) when queried for a \u2217 . If a \u2217 \u2208 A out t out is not a pay-out address, Procedure (4) is used to \ufb01nd a transaction t \u2217 that has a \u2217 as an input address, i.e., a \u2217 \u2208 A in t \u2217 . a \u2217 is a change address if and only if there exists at least one a \u2208 A out t \u2217 for which Procedure (7) returns a trade. In case a \u2217 is a change address, it is treated as a deposit address in approach 2. If a \u2217 is neither a change address nor a pay-out address, it is likely part of the liquidity management process. Approach 2: The second approach employs the trade- speci\ufb01c deposit address a dep . Extracting the corresponding deposit transaction t dep from the blockchain is straightforward using Procedure (4). Similar to A out t out referring to multiple users\u2019 pay-out addresses, A in t dep may include deposit addresses for several trades. Formally, two distinct trades e \u0338 = e \u2032 may exist such that\n\ne = ( C in , a dep , v in , t dep ; . . . ) ,\n\ne \u2032 = ( C in , a \u2032 dep , v \u2032 in , t dep , . . . ) .\n\nObservationally, A in t dep comprises three types of addresses: deposit addresses, change addresses, and others. To distinguish between these types, the Evonax interface is employed as described in approach 1. Approach 3: Exploiting the fact that an input transaction t dep may combine multiple deposit addresses as inputs and, similarly, an output transaction t out may comprise several user addresses as outputs has been discussed. In the context of Evonax, a transaction t out can serve as the pay-out transaction for one trade e and, simultaneously, the deposit transaction for another trade e \u2032 , i.e.,\n\ne = ( . . . ; C out , a out , v out , t out ) e \u2019 = ( C in \u2019, a dep \u2019, v in \u2019, t out ; ... )\n\nTherefore, the inputs A in t out of a pay-out transaction t out typically reveal further deposit addresses (and hence trades).\n\nSimilarly, a transaction t dep can simultaneously be the deposit transaction for one trade e and the pay-out transaction for another trade e \u2032 , i.e.,\n\ne = ( C in , a dep , v in , t dep ; ... ) e \u2019 = ( ... ; C out \u2019, a out \u2019, v out \u2019, t dep )\n\nThis property allows us to combine the \ufb01rst two approaches: By applying approach 2 to the hitherto unused input ad- dresses of the pay-out transaction obtained in approach 1 , A in t out , further trades may be discovered. Correspondingly, approach 1 is applied to A out t dep of the deposit transaction t dep that has already been processed in approach 2 .\n\nV. EXCHANGE OPERATIONS\n\nWe use a dataset containing 30 , 402 trades from February 16, 2018 (the \ufb01rst observed trade) to December 31, 2022 to analyze and measure the operations of Evonax. Among the captured trades, 23 , 600 were carried out successfully, while Evonax reported a failure or an an unclear status for the remaining ones. Conversions between cryptocurrencies and US-Dollar are calculated based on data from CoinGecko 6 , using the historical exchange rate at the time of each trade or transaction.\n\nA. Trading Volume\n\nTrading volume, the total value of executed trades within a given time period, is a crucial indicator of an exchange\u2019s popularity. Many exchanges report their trading volume to data aggregators like CoinMarketCap. While there is no public information available on Evonax\u2019s trading volume, it can be calculated based on our data. The total trading volume during the investigated timeframe amounts to approximately $19 , 450 , 000 . A yearly breakdown of successful trades, in- cluding the average volume per trade and the number of trades, is presented in Table I.\n\nTABLEI TOTAL ANDAVERAGE YEARLYTRADING VOLUME\n\nYear Trades Total Volume Average Median\n\n2018 1,815 $ 485,375.99 $ 267.42 $ 11.30 2019 2,307 $ 386,830.42 $ 167.68 $ 8.23 2020 6,601 $ 2,507,694.79 $ 379.90 $ 35.22 2021 11,030 $ 14,666,685.61 $ 1,329.71 $ 61.32 2022 1,847 $ 1,402,123.84 $ 759.14 $ 71.30\n\nTotal 23,600 $ 19,448,71 $ 824.10 $ 44.20\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the number of trades reached its peak in January 2021 and maintained a relatively high level throughout the \ufb01rst half of the year. However, there was a temporary drop in trading count in March. Regarding trading volume, a distinct peak is evident in August 2021, where the total traded value was approximately $6 , 770 , 000 , constituting around \u2248 35% of the entire trading volume on the platform. This outlier results from a low number of very high-value trades, contributing to the unusual difference between median\n\n6 https://www.coingecko.com/\n\nand average trading values in 2021. This anomaly raises suspicions of an individual or group utilizing Evonax for coin laundering, aiming to obscure the on-chain traceability of their payments. Further details are discussed in Section VI-A. Graphs showing detailed trading statistics for Bitcoin and Ether can be found in the appendix.\n\nFig. 1. Monthly trading volume and trading activity\n\nB. User Statistics\n\nTo analyze user behavior, we cluster trades in the dataset into entities based on common pay-out addresses a out or shared e-mail addresses @ mail . This clustering process is re- peated until no new trades are assigned to a cluster. It\u2019s crucial to note that entities may not correspond to individual users, as a user with two trades using different pay-out addresses without supplying an e-mail address would be assigned to two entities. A total of 10 , 484 entities were identi\ufb01ed, with an average of 2 . 25 trades per entity (median 1 ) and an average exchanged value of $1 , 855 . 09 (median $68 . 35 ). The data suggests that a small group of entities dominates Evonax\u2019s trading activity, both in terms of executed trades and exchanged value. Figure 2 displays the cumulative share of overall trading volume and activity, ranking entities by the number of trades and the sum of exchanged value. Notably, 39 entities (or 0 . 37% ) accounted for over half of the overall trading volume, while 1 , 135 entities (or 10 . 83% ) executed half of the trades.\n\nFig. 2. Cumulative share of trading activity and volume\n\nA similar disparity exists in the popularity of trading pairs among the 171 observed pairs. The top 10 pairs, ranked by exchanged value, collectively represent \u2248 77 . 5% of the overall\n\ntrading volume (refer to Table II). Notably, exchanges from Ether to Monero stand out as an outlier within the pairs, constituting over a quarter of the value exchanged on Evonax. This aligns with the trading peak observed in January 2021, where a signi\ufb01cant portion of these trades occurred.\n\nTABLEII MOST POPULARTRADING PAIRS\n\nPair Total Volume Median Count\n\nETH \u2192 XMR $ 5,019,394.95 $ 213.48 313 DOGE \u2192 BTC $ 1,694,832.02 $ 157.03 755 BCC \u2192 BTC $ 1,563,163.82 $ 46,656.89 48 BTC \u2192 XMR $ 1,497,182.09 $ 144.21 2,947 LTC \u2192 XMR $ 1,428,920.31 $ 125.59 391 ETH \u2192 BTC $ 1,092,772.68 $ 478.71 288 BTC \u2192 PAYPAL $ 798,980.40 $ 56.18 4,498 XMR \u2192 ETH $ 748,816.41 $ 150.27 261 BTC \u2192 DOGE $ 640,636.03 $ 21.57 4131 XMR \u2192 BTC $ 592,118.26 $ 788.68 159\n\nVI. CASE STUDIES\n\nIn this section we investigate unusual observations included in our data, aiming to provide explanations for outliers and noteworthy events.\n\nA. Trading Peak in August 2021\n\nIn late August 2021, Evonax witnessed a substantial surge in trading volume, with total trades reaching \u2248 $6 , 800 , 000 , before sharply dropping to \u2248 $130 , 000 in September 2021. Our investigation traced this spike back to 68 high-value trades between August 20 and September 01, 2021, involving Ether and Litecoin exchanged for Monero, ZCash, Dash, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. A total of 54 Ether trades sold 1 , 604 . 05 ETH ( \u2248 $5 , 160 , 000 ), and 16 Litecoin trades sold 10 , 47 . 269 LTC ( \u2248 $1 , 760 , 000 ). All these trades seemed closely linked, with Ether de- posits originating from 13 addresses, ultimately connected to a single Ethereum address 7 , accumulating \u2248 5 , 360 . 6 ETH ( \u2248 $16 , 970 , 000 ). The funds were then split into batches, each up to 122 ETH, and deposited on various exchanges. Litecoin deposits stemmed from addresses in two peeling chains, both originating from addresses accumulating 18 , 201 LTC ( \u2248 $2 , 720 , 000 ) 8 . Common email addresses and a shared Monero payout address further suggested a connection be- tween the Ether and Litecoin trades. Attempts to trace the origin of funds and the whereabouts of exchanged funds were inconclusive. Payouts in ZCash, Dash, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash were forwarded to other addresses, presumably for storage, and have not been moved as of February 05, 2023. Tracking the exchanged Monero coins proved impossible due to Monero\u2019s privacy-preserving design. Between October 06 and October 09, 2021, trading activity resumed with 5 trades exchanging 39 ETH ( \u2248 $140 , 000 ) for\n\n7 0xbebb0ce4b28403c1b05ecd28e300c4db6b418032 8 ltc1qzj69lwnjea99dkjgyy7rf5wx0vrx72g3lml0nc and LfQysUPZQu6otwFQwEP7DCZfSzgQTZ6nUT\n\nTABLEIII COIN SWAPSBY CURRENCY\n\nCurrency Count Total Amount Total Value\n\nEther 13 13.15206 $ 53,588.45 Litecoin 745 149.6992 $ 24,318.17 Bitcoin 36 0.827579 $ 9,523.45 Dogecoin 75 134,865.5 $ 2,840.00 Bitcoin Cash 2 0.1659801 $ 155.73 Tether 1 90.04 $ 89.99 Dash 5 0.26288 $ 69.30 Monero 2 0.1871228 $ 36.23\n\nTotal 933 $ 90,621.37\n\nMonero, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin. Subsequent transactions using the Dogecoin and Bitcoin payouts showed no interactions with known addresses.\n\nB. Coin Swaps\n\nCertain exchanges, such as ChangeNOW and Evonax, offer \u201ccoin swaps\u201d, allowing users to exchange funds within the same currency, i. e. C in = C out . Despite the initial coun- terintuitiveness of trading money for a smaller amount of the same currency, Evonax\u2019s handling of the swaps hints towards possible use cases. Instead of merely forwarding deposited funds from the user\u2019s deposit address a dep to the pay-out address a out , coin swaps draw funds from other users\u2019 deposit addresses or, for account-based currencies, Evonax\u2019s hot wallet. This process conceals the true sender\u2019s address from the recipient, as a dep / \u2208 A in t out . Consequently, coin swaps can serve as a means to obscure currency \ufb02ows, making it challenging for external observers to trace fund movements. To ascertain evidence of coin swaps being employed for currency \ufb02ow obfuscation, we analyze relevant trades on Evonax, observing 933 coin swaps across 8 different curren- cies. Table III reveals Litecoin as the primary currency for coin swaps, with Ether standing out due to infrequent but high- value swaps. Subsequently, we focus on inspecting coin swaps in Ether, as it is the currency with the largest swapped values. Ethereum addresses engaged in swaps were manually in- spected via Etherscan and its database of known addresses. The analysis identi\ufb01ed a single source responsible for the majority of swapped Ether: On October 21, 2021, a total of around 12 . 93 ETH ( \u2248 $53 , 280 ) were swapped in three trades. Strong evidence links these swaps to a rug pull , a fraudulent scheme involving the creation and listing of a worthless ERC- 20 token on a (decentralized) exchange, followed by the removal of liquidity, deceiving victims into buying worthless tokens [10].\n\n\u2022 1 st swap: On October 21, 2021, an ERC-20 token named \u201cDIOINU\u201d was created, and one trillion DIO tokens and 2 ETH were supplied to a Uniswap v2 liquidity pool. Shortly afterward, the majority of the liquidity pool was drained, transferring around 327 billion DIO tokens and approximately 6 . 15 ETH back to the creator\u2019s address. Around 3 . 35 ETH were sent to Evonax, swapped, and\n\npaid to a deposit address 9 of the now-defunct exchange FTX.\n\n\u2022 2 nd swap: Approximately six hours later, 4 ETH from the FTX hot wallet were observed being sent to an Evonax deposit address 10 , swapped, and paid to another Ethereum address 11 .\n\n\u2022 3 rd swap: Using the same address, an ERC-20 token named \u201cMADARAINU\u201d was created, mirroring the \ufb01rst rug pull\u2019s procedure. Around 50 minutes after the second swap, 5 . 58 ETH were transferred to Evonax, swapped, and paid to the same FTX deposit address as the funds from the \ufb01rst rug pull. This suggests that Evonax was used to conceal the FTX user from rug pull victims and the rug pulls from FTX. For the six other Ethereum swaps interacting with known addresses, no criminal activity was observed: Two swaps were part of a round-trip trade, exchanging currency for Ether, swapping Ether, and ultimately exchanging back to the original currency (BTC and USDT). In another two swaps, the swapped funds were forwarded to the same address initiating the swap. Two swaps involved other exchanges, with funds obtained from HitBTC and Kraken being swapped and, in one case, immediately deposited to Coinbase.\n\nVII. DISCUSSION\n\nDespite the powerful insights gained from our data analysis, generalizing our \ufb01ndings is challenging due to Evonax\u2019s small scale compared to industry leaders. Binance, for instance, had an hourly trading volume approximately 50 times greater than Evonax\u2019s total trading volume during the study period. A fundamental challenge is the lack of a ground truth to assess dataset completeness. Trades exchanging funds between two currencies that were ignored in the blockchain analysis, and that were not otherwise connected to known trades, may not have been captured during data collection. Hypothetically, there could exist a set of trades entirely disconnected from all known trades, thus escaping our methodology. We rely entirely on Evonax\u2019s track exchange functionality, and any inaccuracies in its data, intentional or due to software bugs, would impact our dataset. However, there is no evidence of widespread issues. The initial trade in our dataset, by Evonax\u2019s owner on February 16, 2018, predates the service\u2019s \ufb01rst Inter- net Archive capture (May 23, 2018). Evonax\u2019s predecessor, ExchangeMyCoins.com , reported an average of 372 trades per month when sold in 2017, aligning with the 400 trades per month we observed [11]. This suggests our approach retrieved most trades until the service\u2019s inception. Ultimately, the success of our analysis is constrained by available data, especially when exploring fund origin and destination, given the scarcity of reliable sources for identi\ufb01ed cryptocurrency addresses. Researchers with access to more comprehensive data could potentially yield further insights.\n\n9 0xb9df6eAeAA5238b3f64827a967cE5b9Fac215928 10 0x198207bcc810a4c653cc0ce0ca3b3cf6df06c737 11 0xd48049d09530356B169523243e44c8F982e4D062\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] H.

Option contracts in cryptocurrency markets offer functionalities akin to traditional markets, providing investors with tools to mitigate risks, particularly those arising from price volatility. The paper discusses these applications of option contracts in the context of decentralized finance, emphasizing their utility in managing market uncertainties. Despite a recent surge in the trading volume of option contracts on cryptocurrencies, decentralized platforms account for less than 1% of this total volume. Hence, this paper takes a closer look by examining the design choices of these platforms to understand the challenges hindering their growth and adoption. It identifies technical, financial, and adoption-related challenges faced by decentralized exchanges. Subsequently, the paper provides commentary on existing platform responses.",

INTRODUCTION Option contracts are financial derivatives that give its holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price ( strike price ) within a specified period of time ( expiration date ) [1]. These contracts provide investors with flexibility in their investment strategies by offering a wide range of uses, including hedging, income generation, and risk management. All these allow investors to tailor their investment approach to their specific objectives and market conditions, making option contracts a valuable tool in traditional finance. As per FIA, a leading global trade organization, 2023 saw a trading volume of 100 billion option contracts globally and a growth rate of 100% over its previous year 1 . In the remainder of this paper, we use the term \u201coptions\u201d and option contracts interchangeably. Like traditional assets, options are also traded for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin [2] and Ethereum [3]. Roughly speaking, the financial markets for cryptocurrencies can be classified into centralized- (CeFi) and decentralized-finance (DeFi). CeFi involves custodial applications and services that are managed by a registered corporation. On the other hand, DeFi consists of autonomous programs, known as smart contracts, running on blockchains that replace central interme- diaries to provide financial services. Characterized by zero market downtime, application interoperability, and permissionless access, DeFi has seen rapid user adoption\n\n1 https://www.fia.org/fia/etd-tracker\n\nin recent years with over 50 million unique market participants 2 . With billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL), evidently, it has emerged as a successful alternative to \u201ctraditional\u201d financial services, including spot exchanges ( $19 . 8 billion), futures exchanges ( $2 . 7 billion), decentralized lending services ( $32 . 9 billion), and risk-free yield services ( $55 . 2 billion) [4]. Apart from providing flexibility in investment strate- gies, the existence of options in a DeFi ecosystem have the potential to mitigate many existing risks, especially those stemming from heightened volatility. However, to the best of our knowledge, no substantial work discusses at length current solutions offering options in DeFi. Thus, it becomes important to examine the current landscape so to understand the associated challenges. This paper delves into the realm of option exchanges for cryptocurrencies. After outlining the fundamentals of options, we underscore their significance in DeFi by exploring their potential to address numerous ongoing challenges stemming from the early stage of DeFi markets, particularly focusing on mitigating the effects of increased volatility. Thereafter, the paper studies existing option exchanges, both centralized (CEXes) and decentralized (DEXes), under three aspects: (i) how the platform(s) work, (ii) user benefits and shortcom- ings, and (iii) market adoption trends. Our findings demonstrate that despite harnessing the inherent advan- tages of blockchains, DEXes have historically captured a significantly lower market share (less than 1% ) in options trading. Nevertheless, recent advancements in option DEX protocols and user interfaces are fostering a notable improvement in this trajectory. Consequently, the paper proceeds to elucidate the technical and finan- cial challenges faced by the DEXes that hinder their mainstream adoption. It is important to note that while regulatory hurdles behind options is an open issue 3 , our paper focuses on addressing only technical challenges. In this study, we employ a systematic methodology, concentrating on the four largest CEXes and the seven largest DEXes by trading volume on Ethereum. We select Ethereum because it is the largest DeFi ecosystem with over $55 . 9 billions in TVL [4]. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first deep-dive investigation into the options landscape within the context of DeFi.\n\n2 https://dune.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time 3 https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/09/sec- regulation-of-defi-could-box-out-diverse-entrepreneurs-and-impact- projects/\n\n60 80 100 120\n\nSpot Price (S)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nPrice\n\nPayoff BS value\n\n(a) Call Option Valuation\n\n70 90 110 130\n\nSpot Price (S)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nPrice\n\nPayoff BS value\n\n(b) Put Option Valuation\n\nFig. 1: Value of options calculated using the B-S model\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II gives preliminaries on options, Section III discusses applica- tions of options in DeFi, Section IV gives an overview of option exchanges, Section V examines various design aspects of DEXes, Section VI presents the implementa- tion challenges faced by an exchange, and finally, the paper is concluded in Section VII.\n\nII. BACKGROUND This section presents the basic characteristics of op- tions, including estimation models for determining their price. Then, we present everlasting options that will be useful for the rest of the paper.\n\nA. Option Fundamentals An option is called a call or a put if it gives its holder the rights to buy or sell, respectively, an underlying asset at a strike price of K . Let S denote the spot price of the underlying asset. Then, the payoff of an option is defined as the value obtained by its holder if they exercise their rights and is determined using S and K . For a call option, the payoff is positive if the spot price is above the strike price when exercised, while the opposite holds for a put option:\n\nPayoff = \u001a max( S \u2212 K, 0) , for call options max( K \u2212S , 0) , for put options (1)\n\nSimilarly, the notional value of an option is defined as the value of its underlying asset. For instance, if a call option for 1 ETH is created, and the price of ETH is\n\nEverlasting Option\n\nFixed-term Options\n\nDay 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4\n\nBuy Everlasting Option\n\nBuy Option 1 expiring on Day 1\n\nSell Option 1 & buy Option 2 expiring on Day 2\n\nDay 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4\n\nPay Funding Fee\n\nPay Funding Fee\n\nPay Funding Fee\n\nSell Option 2 & buy Option 3 expiring on Day 3\n\nSell Option 3 & buy Option 4 expiring on Day 4\n\nFig. 2: Comparison between everlasting options and rolling daily options.\n\n$1000 , then the notional value of this option is $1000 . Notional values serve to quantify option trading volume, commonly referred to as notional volume. Apart from payoff and notional value, options have a theoretical valuation that is harder to calculate than the previous two. The first method in calculating it has been the Black-Scholes (B-S) model [5]. It assumes the asset\u2019s price follows a Geometric Brownian Motion [6], and its input parameters include the asset\u2019s spot price, the risk-free interest rate, the option\u2019s strike price, market volatility, and time to expiration. Figures 1a, 1b illustrate the value of a European call and put option, respectively, calculated using numerical methods for Black-Scholes pricing [7]. Here, we assume a strike price of 100 , volatility of 20% per year, a term of 1 year, and a zero interest rate. The B-S model is useful since it can help estimate future values for volatility , which represents the uncer- tainty in the asset\u2019s price. Mathematically, it is defined as the standard deviation of an asset\u2019s daily returns over a time window, usually a year. Specifically, given that options are freely traded on exchanges, one can use their market prices as inputs to the B-S equation. Then, the volatility value that satisfies the equation serves as an estimate, commonly known as implied volatility . Finally, options can be either fixed-term or perpetual. Fixed-term options expire on a particular day, while perpetual options have no expiration. Options can further be classified based on their exercise methods. European options can only be exercised at the time of expiration. Therefore, these options are always fixed-term. On the other hand, American options can be exercised at any time until expiration. Therefore, such options can have both fixed-term and perpetual terms.\n\nB. Everlasting Options\n\nEverlasting options, as introduced in [8], represent perpetual options wherein the contract holder is obli- gated to pay a daily funding fee to maintain the option\u2019s validity. These options are particularly significant to holders who desire flexibility in the holding period. They\n\nserve as an alternative to continually rolling over mul- tiple fixed-term options with incrementally increasing expirations. In the rollover strategy, as the option nears expiration, the holder executes a rollover by selling the existing option and purchasing a new one with a more distant expiration date. A comparison of both of these options is presented in Figure 2. Contrary to everlasting options, the latter alternative is anticipated to incur higher costs. This is due to the transactional fees associated with buying or selling an option, known as the spread , which are paid to market makers\u2014agents who provide liquidity in the market. Consequently, each time the holder executes a rollover, they must bear additional fees. Furthermore, the fixed- term alternative necessitates the existence of multiple markets, each corresponding to a different expiration date. This results in greater liquidity fragmentation com- pared to everlasting options that rely on a single market. The funding fee for an everlasting option is calculated once per day. It is represented as ( mark \u2212 payoff ) , indi- cating the difference between the option\u2019s trading price on the exchange and its payoff, which is determined at the end of the day. An everlasting option on Day 0 is demonstrated in [8] to be equivalent to a portfolio comprising 1 2 of an option expiring on Day 1 , 1 4 of an option expiring on Day 2 , 1\n\n8 of an option expiring on Day 3 , and so forth. This equivalence provides a means to price everlasting options by decomposing them into multiple fixed-term options and leveraging the accurately defined valuation provided by the B-S model.\n\nIII. STUDY MOTIVATION Options have the potential to mature DeFi markets by bringing novel services to users to offset the risks of extreme price movements, among other. Some of these key applications are discussed below.\n\nA. Portfolio optimization Options are particularly useful in creating hedging strategies against price volatility . The key idea is to utilize the relationship between the option\u2019s price and the underlying asset\u2019s spot price. As illustrated by the red dashed curves in Figure 1, the price of an option, both call and put, changes non-linearly with the asset\u2019s price. This relationship provides a range of values for the \u03b4 of the option, which represents the slope of the option\u2019s value V with respect to the spot price, i.e. \u03b4 = d V d S . For call options, \u03b4 varies between 0 and 1, while for put options, it ranges from -1 to 0. One can use this property to construct novel portfolios consisting of assets, options, and other derivatives whose net \u03b4 is zero. Such portfolios are interesting because their net value stays the same regardless of price movements in the market and are referred to as \u03b4 -neutral portfolios . A simple example of such a portfolio consists of 1 ETH ( \u03b4 = 1 ), and 2 put options each with \u03b4 = \u2212 0 . 5 . The weighted \u03b4 of this portfolio turns out to be zero: 1 \u2212 2 \u00b7 0 . 5 = 0 . A \u03b4 -neutral portfolio can also ensure its investors a steady income stream with minimal risk from market price fluctuations. In the context of current DeFi plat- forms, RYSK FINANCE [9] uses this strategy to offer a risk-minimized yield to its liquidity providers.\n\nB. Liquidation-free leverage\n\nLeveraged returns, often provided by exchanges, oc- cur when the investment\u2019s payoff exceeds the returns achievable solely through deposited assets or margin. Thus, a trader with a margin of 1 ETH and leverage of 2 \u00d7 gets a return of 2 x % on margin when the price of ETH changes by x % . However, when the price of ETH reduces by 50% , their leveraged return becomes \u2212 100% , reducing the position size to 0 ETH. To mitigate the risk of negative returns where the trader owes the exchange, the exchange may liquidate the trader\u2019s position when the margin approaches zero. Leverage is popular in DeFi and is implemented using overcollateralized lending and perpetual futures platforms [10]\u2013[13]. However, liquidations caused by extreme and momentary price fluctuations, which are typical in today\u2019s cryptocurrency environment [14], can be seen as unfair to traders and they remain a big issue [15]. This risk can be mitigated in some part by using options whose payoff exceeds zero. For call options, this means that the spot price is greater than the strike price and vice-versa for put options. To understand this, consider the example of the call option plotted in Figure 1a. Here, the strike price is $100 , and the spot price is $120 . The option\u2019s B-S value, as shown in the figure, is approximately $120 \u2212 100 = 20 . For higher values of spot price, the option\u2019s value changes almost linearly with a slope of 1 . This means that a x % increase in the spot price increases the option\u2019s value by 120 \u00b7 x\n\n100 which is 120\n\n20 \u00b7 x % of the option\u2019s original value. Thus, the return on the option gets levered by 6 \u00d7 . On the other hand, if the spot price reduces by 50% , or any larger value, the position does not get liquidated. If in the future the spot price returns to its original value, the user\u2019s position returns to their initial state without incurring any loss (neglecting any time-value decay).\n\nC. Liquidation-free loans\n\nOver-collateralized lending protocols such as Aave [16], Compound [17], and Morpho [18] have become an established financial instrument in modern DeFi. Such protocols enable borrowing of an asset, such as ETH, by depositing a different collateral, e.g. USDC, of much larger value. At all times during the loan duration, the collateral must hold a larger value than the loan. Any violation of this condition, even momentarily due to a spike to the price of the underlying asset, can lead to a liquidation of the loan. As before, such liquidations resulting from sudden price fluctuations are detrimental not only to the bor- rowers but also to the DeFi ecosystem as a whole due to associated systemic risks [19]. Zero liquidation loans [20] and reversible call options [21] are two solutions to this problem that use options. At a high level, the first solution requires a user borrowing 1 ETH by depositing 1000 USDC to purchase a call option with a strike price of 1000 from the lender to prevent liquidation. The second solution, on the other hand, introduces agents known as supporters who re- collaterize a loan if it gets undercollaterized and prevent liquidation. In return, supporters receive a reversible call option implicitly written by the borrower.\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nMonths\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nNotional Volume (Billion dollars)\n\nDeribit OKXBinance Delta\n\nFig. 3: Monthly notional volume of BTC and ETH options in 2023.\n\nIV. OVERVIEW OFE XISTINGO PTIONP LATFORMSWe discuss options within the two classes of exchange platforms viz. centralized and decentralized. The latter can be further categorized between composable- and custom rollup- based designs. Subsequent to this classifi- cation, we present an analysis of option design choices within decentralized systems.\n\nA. Centralized Exchanges CEXes function as custodial platforms where users\u2019 digital assets are held by the exchange. Typically, these exchanges operate using traditional limit orderbook de- signs, wherein buyers and sellers submit their price quotes, and a matching engine facilitates trades by pair- ing compatible orders. Currently, CEXes dominate the options trading market, with the leading players being Deribit [22], Delta Exchange [23], Binance [24], and OKX [25]. In terms of market share for notional volume, Binance and OKX each capture 6% , Delta Exchange holds 12% , while Deribit commands the largest share at 76% [26]. Among all cryptocurrencies, options for BTC and ETH are the most heavily traded. Figure 3 illustrates the monthly notional volume for BTC and ETH options traded on the aforementioned CEXes. In the previous year (2023), the cumulative volume of BTC options reached an impressive $325 billion, while ETH options stood at $162 billion, nearly half of BTC\u2019s volume. These figures underscore the significant demand for op- tions within the market. It\u2019s noteworthy that the current options market is primarily focused on BTC and ETH, indicating a substantial opportunity for the expansion of option derivatives to encompass a broader range of assets.\n\nB. Decentralized Exchanges Composable Designs: Composability in DeFi refers to the interaction between multiple applications, each benefiting from the other\u2019s permissionless and public in- frastructure [27], [28]. Traditional finance has limitations on practical composability due to its permissioned nature and high barrier to entry. On the other hand, composable smart contracts serve as fundamental building blocks\n\nwithin the DeFi ecosystem, or money LEGOs, allowing other financial applications to be built on top of them. In the context of composable option DEXes, we consider only those design paradigms that facilitate end-to-end order execution through smart contracts on a public and permissionless blockchain (Layer-1 or -2). This entails quoting and settling of buy and sell orders entirely on the blockchain. Despite leveraging on the advantages of composabil- ity, this category of exchanges has struggled to gain user adoption compared to centralized exchanges. In 2023 , they accounted for a cumulative volume of $1 . 7 billion [29], representing only 0 . 35% of the trading volume observed on the centralized counterparts. One of the major reasons is the difficulty posed by application development on smart contracts due to the constraints imposed by the underlying blockchain infrastructure, such as high gas cost, adherence to specific virtual machines and contract languages. These limitations can restrict flexibility in design choices, often forcing devel- opers to adopt innovative workarounds as discussed in Section V. To address this, some designs opt for custom rollups, as discussed next, although this may come at the expense of composability. Custom Rollup-based Designs: Layer-2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability of blockchain net- works without altering the underlying trust assumptions. These protocols operate atop Layer-1 blockchains and offer various scaling mechanisms. Among these, roll-ups are the predominant scaling solutions for DeFi protocols deployed on Ethereum [30]. Their primary objective is to alleviate the burden on the main chain by batching trans- action executions off-chain and consolidating them for on-chain verification. This yields significantly reduced, between 10 \u2212 20 \u00d7 , transaction costs [31]. In the realm of decentralized finance, Layer-2 solu- tions tailored specifically for DeFi projects are termed appchains [32]. Among option appchains, AEVO (for- merly known as Ribbon Finance) [33] is the most successful on Ethereum in terms of trading volume [4]. AEVO adopts an orderbook mechanism for BTC and ETH options, similar to CEXes, where buyers and sellers post their orders off-chain. Once an order is matched, settlement occurs on the AEVO rollup. Unlike CEXes, users retain custody of their assets on appchains. How- ever, users may typically experience a waiting period of as much as 2 hours for order confirmation and/or asset withdrawal. Unlike composable designs, which benefit from net- work effects within the ecosystem, appchains are prone to isolation. Neglecting this aspect can significantly hin- der the success of the protocol. One effective approach to addressing this issue is introducing multiple DeFi products on the appchain that add value to each other. This is observed in AEVO, which also operates as a perpetual futures exchange. Parameters such as funding rates from the futures exchange are then used to price options on altcoins in the options exchange. Although user adoption trends on appchains were similar to composable designs with a notional volume of $928 million in 2023 , this category has seen a recent surge with $14 . 9 billion in the first two months of 2024 [29]. The former volume comprises 0 . 2% while the latter comprises 16 . 9% of the volume on centralized\n\nexchanges. These figures underscore a significant uptick in user interest in decentralized options trading.\n\nV. DECENTRALIZED OPTION DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS A key consideration required while designing a decentralized application is execution efficiency, owing to the cost of gas associated with each execution step. Traditional orderbook-based designs necessitate submitting multiple quotes over time, leading to increased gas costs. In an effort to provide an efficient alternative, several smart contract-based designs have been proposed and implemented, each differing in terms of option duration, oracle requirements, and price discovery mechanisms. We discuss these aspects for the protocols AEVO [33], LYRA [34], DERI [35], RYSK FINANCE [9], DOPEX [36], HEGIC [37], and PREMIA [38] in the subsequent text. Notably, except for AEVO, the rest of the protocols belong to the composable category.\n\nOption Duration: As described in Section II-A, op- tions can be categorized as either fixed-term or perpet- ual. Market participants, including option writers and traders, have long favored fixed-term options due to their established track record and familiarity. Conse- quently, an extensive body of literature exists on finan- cial strategies utilizing fixed-term options [1]. Despite their popularity, fixed-term on-chain options present numerous implementation challenges, including constant market renewals after each expiration, which results in higher gas costs that can be particularly problematic for short-term options. Additionally, liquidity fragmentation among different expiration terms contributes to an over- all low liquidity for each duration. Nevertheless, six of seven on-chain protocols\u2013\u2014namely AEVO, LYRA , RYSK FINANCE , DOPEX , HEGIC , and PREMIA \u2014\u2013offer fixed-term options, underscoring the industry\u2019s emphasis on standardization. On the other hand, DERI is one of the few exchange designs to offer perpetual options. It implements everlasting options as the underlying financial instrument. While everlasting options have gained popularity among the perpetual category, alternative designs such as Panoptic [39] and Everlasting Asian Options [40] have also been proposed for decentralized perpetual options. However, these designs are relatively new and thus present a lack of research on strategies for various participants, particularly option writers, who may be hesitant to participate significantly due to under-confidence in assessing their risks and incentives.\n\nOracle Choices: Since blockchains operate as isolated systems, they lack direct access to real-world (off-chain) data. However, decentralized derivatives applications often require continuous monitoring of the underlying asset, such as its spot price. In these scenarios, oracles, which are third-party data providers, play a crucial role as data sources that bridge smart contracts with the outside world [41]. They are widely utilized in DeFi protocols to fetch various types of data, including spot price, trading volume, and price volatility. Despite their utility, oracles introduce several chal- lenges to DeFi projects. Both centralized and decen-\n\ntralized oracle designs are susceptible to malfunctions and manipulations, as witnessed in past exploits [42]. Such incidents can have a significant impact on DeFi applications unless preemptive mitigation strategies are adopted [43], [44]. Decentralized option exchanges typically rely on oracle sources for fetching either price feeds, volatility feeds, or both. Some applications, including RYSK FINANCE , AEVO, and LYRA , also fetch parameters such as risk-free interest rate, forward rate, etc. These parameters are often used for option pricing, as discussed in the subsequent text, or monitor collateral requirements for option writers. Figure 4 presents the oracle feeds used by major on-chain option protocols. Notably, decentralized oracle services such as Chainlink [45], Pyth [46], Oraclum [47], and DIA [48] are mostly utilized for spot price feeds except AEVO which uses weighted prices from 10 exchanges. This choice is more robust than the former, but incurs higher operation and management costs. On the other hand, API feeds from centralized exchanges such as Deribit or services like Block Scholes [49] are used for implied volatility data. Additionally, designs like PREMIA allow for permissionless integration of third-party oracles for spot price feeds. This approach is noteworthy as each oracle has its own benefits and limitations, and having a permissionless design allows protocols to leverage the strengths of multiple oracles.\n\nPrice discovery mechanism: This aspect examines how different protocols quote options prices to buyers and sellers. Price discovery mechanisms can be classified into three categories: (a) market-based where the price is determined by the demand and supply of the option, (b) model-based , where option prices are calculated by the protocol using established financial models, and (c) hybrid where a combination of both is used. In the following, we provide a brief description of each.\n\n1) Market-based: This category of price discovery uses mechanisms such as orderbook-based markets, automated market makers (AMM), or on-chain auctions. Of the seven protocols, AEVO and LYRA use orderbooks for price discovery, with the former using this only for BTC and ETH options. On the other hand, PREMIA employs an AMM-based scheme where they create a concentrated AMM pool for each strike price of an option. This allows the protocol to discover the price for each strike independently.\n\n2) Model-based: This pricing category is the most prevalent among existing on-chain option designs. Vanilla pricing models such as standard Black-Scholes, as used by DOPEX and HEGIC , require input values for spot price, implied volatility, and interest rates. On the other hand, advanced models like SABR [50], as used by AEVO over-the-counter (OTC) [51] and RYSK FINANCE , require additional parameters such as the forward price. While spot price oracles are readily available, sources for other parameters such as implied volatility are scarce. This scarcity is attributed to the immaturity and illiquidity of the options market, especially for altcoins. To confront this challenge, designs like AEVO and RYSK FINANCE use implied\n\nOption Protocol\n\nPrice Feed Oracle\n\nVolatility Feed Oracle\n\nAEVOWeighted price from CEXes\n\nPyth, Deribit\n\nDopex Chainlink, DIADeribit (Offchain)\n\nDeri Oraclum, Pyth Oraclum, Pyth\n\nHegic Chainlink Chainlink\n\nLyra Block Scholes Block Scholes\n\nPremia Permissionless Amberdata/Deribit\n\nRysk Chainlink Deribit (Offchain)\n\nFig. 4: List of oracle feeds used by onchain exchanges.\n\nvolatility and funding fees from off-chain exchanges for BTC and ETH which are then used to derive any additional parameters. Moreover, AEVO calibrates these input parameters to determine volatility for other altcoins. Others like DOPEX and HEGIC use historical volatility feeds and neglect other parameters like interest rates, resulting in approximated outputs.\n\n3) Hybrid: This pricing category is used by DERI for determining the mark price of its everlasting options. DERI uses a mechanism called proactive market-making (PMM) that uses a liquidity pool but functions as an orderbook against which the users\u2019 market orders are filled. That is why it is also referred to as a virtual orderbook . To achieve this, PMM uses two parameters: the initial mid-price of the orderbook and the shape of the orderbook. To calculate the first parameter, i.e., the option\u2019s theoretical value, the spot price, and volatility are fetched from the oracle feed, and the final value is calculated using the pricing formula for everlasting op- tions derived in [35]. The protocol manager controls the second parameter, shaping the orderbook accordingly.\n\nVI. CHALLENGES The substantial notional volume of options traded on CEXes highlights their strong demand and importance within the cryptocurrency markets. Yet, despite this, DEXes collectively own only a small share of the options market. Thus, it is important to understand the challenges that need to be addressed for option DEXes to gain traction.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity Fragmentation: Options with fixed-term expiration require separate markets, one for each strike price and expiry date. This makes aggre- gating sufficient liquidity per market challenging. One solution is the use of perpetual options since they use a single market for multiple time periods, however, they come with their own set of issues as discussed next.\n\n\u2022 Research Gap for Non-Vanilla Options: These op- tions include new designs, such as everlasting op- tions, which aim to address technical challenges arising from vanilla fixed-term options. However,\n\nsuch designs may reveal a gap in the literature concerning strategies, risks, and incentives for vari- ous market participants, namely buyers, sellers, and liquidity providers.\n\n\u2022 Difficulty of Price Discovery: Both market-based and model-based price discovery present chal- lenges. For the first, time value decay is problem- atic since the continuously varying option value requires constantly updating price quotes (in or- derbooks) or reserve states (in AMM), costing significant gas. For the other, complex (non-linear) pricing models create difficulties as it is challenging to accurately and cheaply calculate the price of an option on-chain. Thus, there is a need for innovative solutions for option price discovery that address these challenges.\n\n\u2022 Oracle Vulnerabilities: Almost all decentralized designs depend on oracle feeds for price and volatility, which raises several operational and ef- ficiency challenges. Operational challenges include the inability to list arbitrary assets caused by the lack of volatility feeds for these assets. On the other hand, efficiency challenges are inherent to oracle design and manifest as oracle malfunction and manipulation. By addressing these concerns or completely removing oracle dependency with \u201coracle-less\u201d designs such as Panoptic [39], DeFi options can reach their next phase of adoption.\n\n\u2022 Illiquid Altcoin Markets: The options market for altcoins is still in its early stages and lacks liquidity across all exchanges. This absence of liquidity results in a scarcity of volatility feeds, which in turn discourages other platforms from entering this sector. Although solutions like AEVO aim to ad- dress these challenges by calibrating such markets to BTC and ETH using correlated models, they come with their own limitations. These include invalidity of the model for longer-term options and inaccuracies in correlation assumptions [51].\n\n\u2022 Unresolved Regulatory Issues: Although the obser- vations of this paper are only technical, the DeFi sector is characterized by uncertainties surrounding regulatory issues around many of its activities. Con- sequently, developers are compelled to adhere to subjective \u201cbest practices\u201d, resulting in a deterrent effect on participation [52], which is also a pillar behind the technical observations of this work.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION ANDF UTUREW ORKThis paper highlights the emerging status of options trading in cryptocurrency markets, despite its established status in traditional finance. After discussing the urgent need for a thriving options market, the paper examines current solutions for options trading in both central- ized and decentralized platforms. While high volume in CEXes indicates strong demand for this instrument, decentralized platforms face challenges stemming from technical, adoption, and research issues. This study focuses on platforms with considerable volume, omitting research ideas and proposals that lack market validation. Future research endeavors will explore these unvalidated proposals, aiming to broaden our understanding of op- tions trading in cryptocurrency markets and address the challenges faced by decentralized platforms.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] J.

While a three-year chart is provided to justify the model's validity, the crux of the matter is the value of the information at each data point, crucial for an effective strategy. The inherent issue is that a three-year chart will, by default, replicate the actual market trend to some extent. However, the critical evaluation is how valuable the predicted information is at specific points for a real trading strategy. \n\nSecondly, the core of the model's approach evaluates the smoothed return over the last three days. Given the high correlation among crypto assets relative to a base asset like the USD, any prolonged bullish market trend tends to penalize portfolios containing crypto assets excessively. This is evident in the authors' results, showing the model almost completely shifted the portfolio to USD at the beginning of 2021 and remained there, ignoring the substantial market growth until June of the same year. Therefore, longer prediction periods might be necessary for this type of investment, though the accuracy of predictions is likely to decrease with the extension of the prediction period. Considering shorter periods using the same dataset, which essentially represents the average daily price, seems impractical. The average daily price does not accurately reflect the price at which transactions could be executed on that day due to the high intraday volatility.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency has reformed the financial landscape, introducing a digital asset class characterized by high volatility and the potential for significant returns. Unlike traditional stock markets, the cryptocurrency market operates 24 hours a day, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for traders and asset managers. This new market environ- ment has motivated the development of sophisticated trading strategies, especially leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to navigate its dynamic conditions. Among these innovations, AI-driven trading bots have evolved, promising enhanced decision-making capabilities compared to human traders [1]. Despite the progress in applying AI within the cryptocur- rency domain, challenges remain, particularly in adapting to the market\u2019s rapid volatility and in effective asset manage- ment. Machine learning has proven integral in predicting cryptocurrency price movements by processing vast amounts of market data to uncover complex patterns. However, the application of these insights into real-time asset management is still nascent. While several previous studies have utilized deep neural network models for optimizing asset allocation ratios [2], [3], our research introduces the novel application of\n\nthe Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) model [4] in this context. A2C, a reinforcement learning technique, is uniquely suited for the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Our research aims to bridge this gap by proposing the use of an A2C reinforcement learning model, customized specifically for cryptocurrency trading and asset management. This ap- proach is designed to optimize asset allocation ratios, including cryptocurrencies and USD, by leveraging both current and predicted cryptocurrency price data. We validate the efficacy of our A2C model and show how variations in its reward function parameters impact its behavior and adaptability to evolving market dynamics. Experiment results demonstrated that although the model showed somewhat extreme variations between profitability and loss prevention based on the factor that imposes higher penalties for losses in the portfolio, it effectively reallocated assets according to market changes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion II covers related work in cryptocurrency price prediction, trading, and asset management. Our proposed methodology is presented in Section III, followed by the validation of the proposed model in Section IV. Section V provides some discussions, and finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nA. Cryptocurrency Price Prediction\n\nThe field of cryptocurrency price prediction has seen a pro- liferation of research, with a significant focus on Bitcoin [5]. Researchers have predominantly targeted Bitcoin due to its prominence and volatility, applying various machine learning techniques for price prediction. Notable among these studies, Kim [6] utilized LSTM [7] to predict Bitcoin prices, lever- aging its ability to handle nonlinearity and long-term memory characteristics of the market. This approach not only predicted prices but also analyzed the profitability of investment strate- gies based on these predictions. Similarly, another study by Li et al. [8] introduced a hybrid data decomposition-based bidi- rectional deep-learning model, combining variational mode decomposition and BiLSTM [9], to enhance Bitcoin market prediction accuracy. This model effectively decomposed the Bitcoin price data into various intrinsic modes, improving its predictability remarkably. These studies reflect a trend in the field where advanced machine learning and deep-learning techniques are being increasingly employed to address the challenges posed by the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices, especially Bitcoin.\n\nOrtu et al. [10] explored the use of deep learning algorithms for cryptocurrency price classification, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum [11]. They investigated the impact of combining technical, trading, and social media indicators on the pre- dictability of price movements. The study demonstrated that the inclusion of social media indicators, such as sentiments and emotions extracted from platforms like GitHub [12] and Reddit [13], considerably improved the accuracy of price predictions. This research emphasized the importance of con- sidering a broad range of factors, including social interactions and sentiment, in the volatile cryptocurrency market. These studies collectively highlight a trend towards the uti- lization of advanced machine learning and deep learning tech- niques in cryptocurrency price prediction. They demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in handling the complex and nonlinear nature of cryptocurrency price movements, empha- sizing the importance of incorporating diverse data sources, including social media sentiment, for enhanced predictive accuracy.\n\nB. Cryptocurrency Trading and Asset Management\n\nIn the area of cryptocurrency trading and asset management, most approaches [14]\u2013[16] have focused on investments to a single asset. Unlike them, Jiang and Liang [3] attempted to optimize portfolio management using deep learning methods. They presented a model-less convolutional neural network that took historic prices of crypto assets to output portfolio weights, focusing on maximizing accumulative returns. Their method was unique as it applied a full machine-learning approach without relying on pre-existing financial market models, directly capturing market trends and patterns. The results from their study indicated that their CNN [17] strategy notably outperformed other portfolio selection algorithms. However, there are key areas that could be improved for more robust analysis. Firstly, the duration of the test set used to validate their model\u2019s performance was relatively short, approximately two months. This time frame may not be sufficient to capture the wide array of market conditions, especially considering the high volatility and rapid changes characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. Secondly, while they mentioned utilizing a portfolio of 12 cryptocurrencies includ- ing Bitcoin, the exact list of these assets was not specified. Including a stable asset like USDT [18] or USDollar in the portfolio is crucial, given that many cryptocurrencies are heavily influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s price trends. The inclusion of a stable asset can provide a hedge against market volatility and should be a key consideration in any portfolio management strategy. Lastly, their model did not include the varying asset allocation ratios at each timestamp as an input. This omission means that the objective function used for training their model does not account for transaction fees that would arise from changes in asset allocation. Transaction fees can significantly impact the net performance of trading strategies, especially in a high-frequency trading context like cryptocurrency markets. The ability to factor in these costs is important for practical portfolio management strategies. Ignoring these fees could\n\nresult in an overly optimistic assessment of the model\u2019s performance and may not accurately reflect the strategy\u2019s effectiveness in a real-world trading environment.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n\nThis section presents our approach using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning model to distribute assets within a portfolio comprising various cryptocurrencies and USDollar, aiming to enhance returns and mitigate losses. We have included Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) [19], Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC) [20], and USDollar (USD) in our asset portfolio. USD can be replaced by USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the USD, under certain conditions. These cryptocurrencies were chosen due to their high market capitalization and the availability of extensive historical data.\n\nA. Price Prediction\n\nWe first obtained historical price data of our portfolio\u2019s cryptocurrencies from Binance [21], spanning from the end of 2019 to January 2024. As the focus of this paper is not on predicting cryptocurrency prices with high accuracy, we used a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model [7] suitable for time series data prediction. Our LSTM model consisted of a LSTM layer with 10 units and a Dense layer with a single unit. We pre-processed the downloaded price data into daily timestamps, with the model predicting the next day\u2019s price based on the previous 20 days\u2019 data. The data was split into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing.\n\nFig. 1: The Actual and Predicted BTCPrices\n\nDespite its simplicity, the model effectively follows the actual price trends, as shown in Fig. 1. We found that the model shows similar levels of predictive performance not only for BTC but also for the other cryptocurrencies. In our subsequent A2C model, we use this predicted price data, accepting some noise, to test our model\u2019s effectiveness under less-than-perfect conditions.\n\nB. A2CModel for Crypto Trading and Asset Management\n\nThe A2C model that consists of two main components, the Actor and the Critic, is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods (Fig. 2). The Actor is in charge of\n\ndetermining the actions, essentially dictating the policy of how an agent should behave in a given state. On the other hand, the Critic scores the action taken by the Actor by computing the value function, which is an estimate of the future rewards. One of the key features of A2C is its ability to balance between exploring new actions (exploration) and leveraging the knowledge already acquired (exploitation). This balance is crucial in complex environments where the agent must make decisions under uncertainty. A2C improves upon earlier Actor- Critic methods by updating the policy and value function simultaneously, leading to more stable and efficient learning.\n\nFig. 2: A2CModel for Crypto Trading and Asset Management\n\nIn the context of crypto trading and asset management, A2C\u2019s capability to handle continuous action spaces and its robustness in dealing with complex, dynamic environments make it a suitable choice. The model can learn optimal strategies over time, making it ideal for finding optimal asset allocation ratios in our portfolio. The design of our model\u2019s state, action, and reward is as follows:\n\n\u2022 State : Includes cryptocurrency prices for the current and previous 10 timestamps, current asset allocation ratios, and predicted prices for the next timestamp.\n\n\u2022 Action : New asset allocation ratios for each cryptocur- rency and USD, summing to 1.\n\n\u2022 Reward : The reward function is designed to balance between the portfolio\u2019s profitability and market volatility. The reward is calculated as follows:\n\nReward ( t ) ( s ( t ) , a ( t ) ) = (1 + \u03b1 ( t ) ) \u2217 \u03b3 ( t ) \u2212 \u03b4 ( t ) (1)\n\nwhere\n\nt = Timestamp ,\n\ns ( t ) , a ( t ) = State and Action at t ,\n\n\u03b3 ( t ) = Portfolio\u2019s return rate \u2212 trading fees at t ,\n\n\u03b4 ( t ) = Portfolio\u2019s avg. price change rate at t ,\n\n\u03b1 = Loss penalty factor ,\n\n\u03b1 ( t ) =\n\n( 0 , if \u03b3 ( t ) \u2265 0 or P t t \u2212 2 \u03b3 ( t ) \u2265 0 , \u03b1 given , otherwise\n\nThe loss penalty factor is dynamically adjusted based on the performance of the portfolio. It is set to 0 if the portfolio\u2019s\n\nreturn rate is non-negative or if the average return rate over the last three timestamps is non-negative. Otherwise, the loss penalty factor is set to a predefined value \u03b1 . This mechanism is designed to penalize negative returns, encouraging the model to avoid strategies that consistently result in losses. The reason for considering the average return rate over the last three timestamps in the selection of \u03b1 is to mitigate sensitivity to short-term losses and to smooth the volatility impact. The inclusion of the average price change rate of the portfolio is also important to assess the portfolio\u2019s return rate considering the average market movement. This metric allows for a more nuanced evaluation of the portfolio\u2019s performance by contextualizing its returns against the backdrop of market- wide price fluctuations. By using this measure, the model is better equipped to differentiate between genuine portfolio gains and those merely reflective of the overall market trend. In the calculation of the reward function\u2019s \u03b3 , we accounted for the occurrence of trading fees. The trading fees were applied to each transaction amount at a predetermined fee rate. This is to prevent the model from making excessively frequent and substantial changes to the asset allocation ratios without considering the trading fees. The design of this reward function, with its components and dynamic adjustment, aligns with the primary goal of our methodology: optimizing asset allocation to improve returns while managing risk effectively in the volatile environment of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nIV. EXPERIMENT ANDR ESULTS\n\nIn this section, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the A2C model that we previously described, using the pre- processed dataset. The focus was to observe how varying the loss penalty factor \u03b1 in the reward function influenced the behavior of the trained model. For this experiment, both the Actor and Critic networks in our A2C model were designed with three hidden layers, each containing 256 units. We employed the ReLU [22] activation function for these layers, following standard practices for en- hancing non-linear learning capabilities. In the Actor network, we integrated an output layer with 5 units, corresponding to the number of assets (BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, USD) in our port- folio. This output layer used the softmax activation function, suitable for generating a probability distribution across our portfolio for asset allocation. Conversely, the Critic network was equipped with a single-unit output layer to estimate the value function. For training purposes, we treated the first 70% of the total data\u2019s time period as a training set and iteratively trained the model through multiple episodes (epochs), each being a subset of the training set. The loss penalty factor \u03b1 was varied across experiments with values of 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.25. We assumed that the market possesses sufficient liquidity to accommodate the volume of trades the model wish to execute and that the transaction fee rate is set at 0.1%. As a result, we found that with lower \u03b1 values, the model engaged in more aggressive investment strategies in pursuit\n\n(a) Loss penalty factor \u03b1 = 0 . 5\n\n(b) Loss penalty factor \u03b1 = 1 . 25\n\nFig. 3: Asset allocation ratios for models trained through 25 epochs (episodes) with \u03b1 of 0.5 and 1.25 at each timestamp.\n\nof higher returns. However, one key finding was that during overall market downturns, the model maintained an optimistic outlook, continuing to allocate assets to cryptocurrencies even as their prices were falling. This behavior indicates a tendency of the model to remain invested in depreciating assets under certain market conditions, suggesting a potential area for further refinement. Fig. 3(a) illustrates the asset allocation ratio changes at each timestamp when the model with an \u03b1 of 0.5 was used. Here, we observed that the model predominantly allocated assets to volatile cryptocurrencies, with minimal allo- cation to USD. This tendency indicates the model\u2019s inclination to pursue potentially higher returns by taking on more risk associated with these cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn contrast, as \u03b1 increased, a trend emerged where the model chose lower returns in exchange for minimizing potential losses. As shown in Fig. 3(b), we noted that most of the\n\nportfolio assets were maintained in USD throughout the entire period. This conservative strategy is even more apparent in Fig. 4(b), which shows the total asset value at each timestamp for the model with an \u03b1 of 1.25. Compared to Fig. 4(a), which represents a model with a relatively lower \u03b1 , Fig. 4(b) clearly shows a significantly lower return rate but almost negligible asset depreciation.\n\nFig. 5 shows the total asset value at each timestamp for the model with an \u03b1 of 1, alongside the price change graphs of each cryptocurrency in the portfolio. Among the models trained with different \u03b1 values, this particular model exhibited the most balanced performance. As observed in Fig. 5, the overall increase in cryptocurrency market prices led to a corresponding increase in the total asset value. Conversely, during periods of price decline, the model managed to mitigate extreme drops in asset value.\n\n(a) Loss penalty factor \u03b1 = 0 . 5\n\n(b) Loss penalty factor \u03b1 = 1 . 25\n\nFig. 4: Total asset values at each timestamp for models trained through various epochs (episodes) with \u03b1 of 0.5 and 1.25.\n\nThis behavior demonstrates the model\u2019s capacity to adjust its asset allocation strategies effectively in response to market conditions. In periods of market upswing, the model capital- izes on rising prices, whereas, during downturns, it employs a more cautious approach to safeguard the portfolio\u2019s value. Such a balanced approach, as evidenced in the model with an \u03b1 of 1, demonstrates the model\u2019s versatility in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market, providing a critical insight into optimizing risk-return trade-offs in asset management.\n\nV. DISCUSSION Through our experiments, we discovered that the loss penalty factor \u03b1 significantly influences the tendency of our model. By adjusting \u03b1 , the proposed model can be cus- tomized to suit the user\u2019s objectives, whether it be chasing higher returns or focusing on loss prevention. However, a notable limitation currently exists in our model\u2019s responsive- ness to changes in \u03b1 . We observed that the model tends to\n\nshift abruptly between aggressive and conservative investment strategies based on the value of \u03b1 . We believe this is due to the fact that while the change in \u03b1 itself is small, it results in significant differences in the computed reward. This sensitivity necessitates further refinement of \u03b1 through finer adjustments. Additionally, in the process of improving our model, particularly when modifying the reward function, many parameters may be added to consider a wider range of factors.\n\nThe implementation of AI in cryptocurrency trading and asset management offers substantial advantages over tradi- tional algorithm-based or manual trading approaches. Though algorithm-based trading automates transactions, it still requires users to make significant decisions regarding the choice of indicators and the amount of trading, often without the benefit of continuous market monitoring. This presents a challenge for most individuals who have other commitments and cannot dedicate time to monitor a 24/7 market [23]. Furthermore,\n\n(a) BTC\n\n(b) BCH\n\n(c) ETH\n\n(d) ETC\n\nFig. 5: (Red line) Total asset value at each timestamp for the model with an \u03b1 of 1. The price graphs for each cryptocurrency (Blue line) are drawn on a different scale, intended to compare the overall trend in changes.\n\nAI has the edge in generating insights from given situations, outperforming the capabilities of manual analysis. AI\u2019s ability to process and learn from vast amounts of data enables it to identify opportunities and risks that might be overlooked in manual trading. Hence, AI models like ours, which adapt and respond to market conditions with minimal user intervention, are more advantageous, particularly in the highly volatile and fast-paced cryptocurrency market.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper presented an approach in the field of cryp- tocurrency trading and asset management using the A2C reinforcement learning model. The focus of our research was to optimize asset allocation within a portfolio that includes a mix of high-volatility cryptocurrencies and the more stable USDollar. Our experiments demonstrated the model\u2019s effective- ness and adaptability. By adjusting the loss penalty factor \u03b1 within the reward function, we observed the model\u2019s capability to switch between aggressive and conservative investment strategies in response to the user\u2019s intention. The experimental results highlighted a balance between risk and return, with the model achieving stable asset growth in rising markets and mitigating losses in declining markets. In our future work, we plan to concentrate on three critical aspects of our A2C model for cryptocurrency trading and asset management. Firstly, we intend to analyze how the accuracy of predicted prices impacts the model\u2019s performance. If using actual future data in experiments yields better outcomes, it will highlight an opportunity for improvement in our two- step system architecture, which separates price prediction from asset allocation. Enhancing the accuracy of price predictions\n\ncould boost overall system performance. Conversely, if the differences in performance are minimal, it would indicate that our model can perform comparably well with actual data, even when using predictions with some noise. Such a finding would be essential in verifying the model\u2019s applicability in real-world scenarios, where perfect price prediction is not always achievable. Secondly, we plan to address the observed issue of the model exhibiting extreme performance variations at different \u03b1 values. This will involve revising the reward function and engaging in more thorough hyperparameter tun- ing. By refining the model\u2019s sensitivity to the loss penalty factor, we aim to strike a balance, ensuring a more stable and consistent response to varying market conditions. This approach is expected to lead to a more advanced reward structure, enabling the model to effectively manage the trade- off between risk and reward. Lastly, we aim to apply time- series data with a broader range and finer granularity. As mentioned in this paper, managing assets using only daily data in the rapidly changing and volatile cryptocurrency market is impractical. Therefore, it is important to enhance the model to utilize more extensive data at even shorter intervals.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean Government (RS-2024- 00392332, Development of 6GNetwork Integrated Intelli- gence Plane Technologies) and Smart HealthCare Program (www.kipot.or.kr) funded by the Korean National Police Agency (KNPA, Korea) [Project Name: Development of an Intelligent Big Data Integrated Platform for Police Officers\u2019 Personalized Healthcare / Project Number: 220222M01]\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] M.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Global Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Market is ex- periencing rapid growth due to the rise of decentralized blockchain-based systems, valued at $20 billion in 2023, with a growth rate of 45.36% [1]. DeFi aims to integrate open- source financial components into sophisticated products, to provide frictionless experiences & enhanced user value [2]. However, financial literacy is already scarce, with only 33% of adults possessing it [3]. This scarcity is further amplified by introducing advanced technologies such as blockchain, decentralized exchanges (DEX), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, & secondary marketplaces. Navigating the NFT marketplace requires integrating wal- lets, minting NFTs, and reselling within the DeFi ecosystem. As interest in opening NFT marketplaces grows [4][5], in- dividuals must familiarize themselves with these concepts to effectively utilize available functionalities.\n\nWe thank Brain Station 23 PLC. for their invaluable support in writing this paper.\n\nThis paper aims to be a valuable resource for NFT mar- ketplace owners & bridge the DeFi literacy gap by clarifying various concepts within the DeFi ecosystem. The key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Explanation of DEXs, & AMM algorithm.\n\n\u2022 Clarification of the functioning & purposes of different fungible tokens, including stablecoin, their reserves & decimal scaling.\n\n\u2022 Deciphering the process of primary & secondary market- places, & revenue distribution.\n\n\u2022 Royalty Structure for NFT tokens. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the NFT market within the DeFi landscape, catering to both industry practitioners & academics, offering a structured approach & detailed explanations to understand DeFi & NFT marketplaces.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nA variety of research studies have explored DEXs & NFT marketplaces. Advances in economics, business, & manage- ment research [6] examined the impact of financial liter- acy, risk perception, & overconfidence on cryptocurrency investment decisions. Jean-Michel Chabot [7] examined the digital asset investment landscape, operational risks for cryp- tocurrency investors, & institutionalization of digital asset investment, including risks in cryptocurrency & blockchain opportunities. The landscape of the NFT market presents a rapidly evolving domain with implications for investors & reg- ulatory bodies. Mukhopadhyay [8] highlights the challenges of differentiating authentic and fraudulent NFTs, emphasizing the need for due diligence. White [9] conducted a detailed examination of the OpenSea NFT marketplace, shedding light on the impact of select users on price fluctuations & the emergence of user communities. Their study analyzed 5.25 million sales over 3 years (2019-2021). Furthermore, Madha- van [10] delivers an extensive survey of market microstructure,\n\nemphasizing the role of information in price determination, market configuration, & its intersection with other financial realms. Overall, NFTs offer diversification opportunities with substantial risk-bearing potential. Related works suggest a lack of literature to assist new & emerging NFT marketplace owners & investors entering the world of blockchain. There is a shortage of literature on the market microstructure of NFTs & how marketplace owners can navigate this market.\n\nIII. PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nTo provide comprehensive information, we have chosen a narrative format. Our story follows an NFT patron who wants to acquire & sell an NFT. The narrative is shown in \u201cFig. 1\u201d. ERC20 tokens are needed for transactions on the blockchain & to mint NFTs. The patron must purchase cryptocurrency (1). If the user already has cryptocurrency but it is not native to the platform, they will need to exchange it (2). Section IV(A) explains this process & introduces DEX. When choosing an ERC20 token to purchase, the patron must decide between native & stable coins (2). Native coins can be volatile, while stablecoins have a stable price. Section IV(B) addresses this. With their chosen ERC20 token, the patron can select a digital asset to mint from a primary marketplace (4), which our protagonist proprietor owns.\n\nFig. 1. Diagram For Narrative\n\nMinting an NFT requires native coins (5). Even if mar- ketplace owners list prices in stablecoin, they still need to\n\nconvert them to the native coin to pay gas fees when minting NFTs. To obtain real-time price conversion rates, Oracles are used (7). However, it is worth noting that Oracles may not always provide the expected decimal places, which can create issues with decimal scaling (6). Section IV(C) provides more information about Oracles & delves into this challenge. When the artist confirms the payment, a new NFT corre- sponding to the asset is minted (9). These NFTs follow the ERC721 token standard & are unique & indivisible. They are registered on all secondary marketplaces within the Web3 eco space (10). Section IV(D) thoroughly explores the concept of NFTs. When an NFT is distributed to a different market, the control over revenue distribution is lost, posing a challenge for marketplace owners (11) (12) (13). This will be discussed further in Section IV(D), which explains the concept of listing & trading NFTs on secondary marketplaces. When a buyer purchases a token from a secondary marketplace, revenue distribution will depend on the NFT\u2019s royalty standard (14). The royalty standards (15) (16) are explained in Section IV(D). It also includes our novel royalty-enabled revenue distribution.\n\nIV. METHODOLOGY\n\nA. Decentralized Exchange\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) enable direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading without intermediaries like banks [11]. Users pay network & trading fees, collected by the protocol, liquidity providers, or token holders. DEXs operate via smart contracts, establishing prices algorithmically & liquidity pools. \u2022 Liquidity pool : A liquidity pool is a smart contract holding a reserve of two or more cryptocurrency tokens in a DEX [12]. The term liquidity pool refers to the creation of liquidity for faster transactions. The transaction fee for each trade executed on the platform is shared by the liquidity providers based on their contributions [13]. \u2022 Automated Market Maker : Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are algorithms like the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) to set asset prices in liquidity pools, by maintaining a constant, denoted as \u2019k,\u2019 ensuring stability. This constant is initially set at 1 dollar & remains unchanged. Most AMMs are represented by the equation: X * Y = KWhere: X is Supply of Token A, Y is Supply of Token B, & K is Constant. Essentially, the product of token quantities in the pool is always constant. \u2022 Arbitrage Trading : Arbitrage traders engage in the practice of purchasing tokens from pools where prices are lower & selling them to pools where prices are higher, thereby balancing token supply & promoting ecosystem stability. Re- strictions on their capital flow can disrupt liquidity & hinder price convergence [14].\n\nB. ERC 20 Tokens (Fungible Tokens)\n\nDEXs operate with ERC-20 tokens, providing access within a broader crypto-economic system. [15]. ERC-20 tokens, fungible like fiat currency, hold the same value & are easily exchanged. They follow the ERC-20 standard, governed by\n\nsmart contracts developed by OpenZeppelin, facilitating vari- ous applications like exchange, voting, & staking [16]. ERC- 20 tokens offer standardized functions, security [17], reduced costs, & liquidity on exchanges. Native coins are essential, as they are used for NFT minting, liquidity pool investing, & acquiring digital assets within the DeFi ecosystem. \u2022 Native Coins : Native coins are fungible ERC-20 tokens native to a specific blockchain network [18], such as Ether for Ethereum and MATIC for Polygon[19]. \u2022 Stablecoins : Stablecoins are ERC20 tokens that maintain a stable value by being pegged to another asset, usually a fiat currency [20]. They require extra functionalities to control sup- ply, offering an alternative to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them suitable for daily transactions. Stablecoins pegged to fiat currency are called fiat- collateralized stablecoins. They operate under a centralized model, where a centralized entity holds an equivalent amount of fiat currency in reserve as the circulating token in the market. However, they compromise decentralization as a cen- tral entity manages the reserves. The two other types of stablecoins are Cryptocurrency collateralized stablecoins (use cryptocurrency as collateral & require over-collateralization to remain stable) & Algorithmic stablecoins (Algorithmically adjust supply to stabilize prices based on market dynamics).\n\nC. Decimal scaling between tokens\n\nCryptocurrencies may have different decimal precision points. For example: MATIC has up to 18 decimal places, & USDC has 6 decimal places. To convert between USDC & MATIC (tokens with different decimal places), we multiply or divide based on the difference in decimal places. In this instance, to convert from USDC to MATIC, we multiply the value by 10 18 - 6 . To convert from MATIC to USDC, we would divide the value with 10 18 - 6 . When weaving pricing into scaling, the decimal precision is adjusted to match the token with the larger decimal precision. This ensures we do not truncate a value, & lose precision.\n\nD. NFT market microstructure\n\nNFTToken standards: NFTs are blockchain-based assets representing ownership of a single digital or physical item [21]. \u2022 ERC-721: ERC-721 is the standard for NFTs. Unlike fungible tokens, ERC-721 tokens are unique. The standard ensures that each token within a smart contract has a globally unique combination of the contract address & a uint256 tokenId, and is governed by smart contracts developed by OpenZeppelin [22], ERC-721 allows ownership of the token & transfer, balance inquiry of the Token, ownership lookup for specific token ID, & approval for third-party accounts to transfer tokens. The contract can emit three events Transfer , Approval & ApprovalForAll . \u2022 ERC 1155: ERC-1155 is a multi-token standard that combines ERC-20 & ERC-721. It represents both fungible and non-fungible tokens, making it a semi-fungible token. Key fea- tures of ERC-1155 are Batch Transfer, Batch Balance, Batch\n\nApproval, Hooks, NFTSupport & Safe Transfer Rules. The events are TransferSingle , TransferBatch , ApprovalForAll & URI . Each token can be unique & have a balance. 1) NFT marketplace: There are marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, Magic Eden, etc. Whenever an NFT appears in the blockchain ecosystem, they are immediately displayed on the marketplaces. This adds to the democratization of the blockchain ecosystem, allowing owners to create NFTs & sell them. If an NFT is sold at a marketplace, the marketplace keeps a royalty fee from the buyer. \u2022 Primary Marketplace: The primary marketplace is where NFTs are minted, serving as their place of origin. \u2022 Proprietary secondary marketplace: The marketplace belonging to the NFT proprietor is the proprietary secondary marketplace. The resale value from this site goes to the NFT owner & commission is obtained by the original NFT minter. \u2022 Third party secondary marketplace: Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, & Magic Eden are third-party secondary marketplaces that list any tokens minted on-chain. Token owners can use these marketplaces to sell their tokens, with the resale value going to the owner & the commission being owned by the marketplace. 2) How Token Transfer works in OpenSea: As per the ERC-721 standard, a token can have a token operator. The token owner must approve the operator. A token operator has permission to transfer the token. When a token is listed for sale in the secondary marketplace by the token owner, a SetApprovalForAllFunction event is emitted from the ApprovalForAll function, as shown in \u201cFig. 2\u201d. The ApprovalForAll function sets a contract named Con- duit.sol as the token operator. The Conduit.sol contract can be found on polygonscan. As per the contract\u2019s NatSpec comments, the contract serves as the originator for proxied transfers, & serves as the transferrer for any ERC tokens. The contract executes the transfer using the execute function.\n\nFig. 2. Setting contract address as token operator flow\n\nWhen the Buyer buys the token from OpenSea,the fullfill- BasicOrder function of Seaport.sol is called. First, the order is validated & conduit data is loaded from the contract. Then the transfer is called using Conduit & the token transfer takes place. Afterwards, the fee distribution takes place. The seller receives 99.75% of the transfer amount & OpenSea receives 0.25% as shown in \u201cFig. 3\u201d. Figures display contracts designed by OpenSea and are a part of the Seaport market protocol. 3) Royalty Standard: In the Web3 eco-space, there should be effective monetization of NFT transfers to ensure creators\u2019 & owners\u2019 rights are properly preserved. Users can buy or mint tokens from one place & sell them on various secondary marketplaces online. However, this can result in creators not receiving the royalty fees they are entitled to when the NFT is sold. Therefore, it is crucial to\n\nFig. 3. OpenSea token buying flow\n\nestablish a standardized system that consistently incentivizes token creators for every transfer. ERC-2981 is a royalty standard that incentivizes creators. Creators receive a percentage of secondary sales on NFTs, facilitating fair compensation. If a marketplace chooses not to implement this ERC, no funds will be paid for secondary sales. Adoption of this standard by NFT marketplaces supports artists and encourages buyers to consider royalties in their purchases. OpenZepplin has the royalty standardized using the ERC-2981 standard. If a smart contract inherits it, it will have access to setting royalty. \u201cFig. 4\u201d, \u201cFig. 5\u201d, \u201cFig. 6\u201d show the process of generating royalty.\n\nFig. 4. Setting Royalty Amount During Minting\n\nFig. 5. First Token Transfer after setting Royalty\n\nFig. 6. Consecutive Token Transfers after setting Royalty\n\nFig. 7. Approving Royalty Fee Transfer During Selling\n\nFig. 8. Royalty Transfer During Selling Token at any marketplaces\n\nRoyalty Calculation: The default royalty rate is set to 10%. This percentage must remain constant regardless of the sale price. If the calculation results in a remainder, implementers have the flexibility to round up or down to the nearest integer. Our proposed Royalty Distribution Mechanism: We pro- pose another royalty standard that can be used instead of the ERC2981 royalty standard. It will give the origin marketplace more control over the tokens on that platform. In our case, the origin marketplace will listen to the SetApprovalForAll event. Its emission means that any third-party contract or address has been set as the token operator. So our platform will ask the owner to confirm that indeed the owner has listed the token on another platform & they need to pay 2.5% to the host platform as well. The 2.5% transfer occurs when the token transfer occurs. \u201cFig. 7\u201d & \u201cFig. 8\u201d narrates this procedure. The ApprovalForAll function should be overridden & our conduit should be set as Operator. Whenever ApprovalForAll is invoked, the setApprovalForAll event is emitted. We can then warn the user that the token has been listed in Secondary Marketplace. During the transfer, the origin marketplace will also get a 2.5% royalty from the transfer.\n\nV. FUTURE WORK\n\nWhile this study has provided a comprehensive analysis, further research into proposed royalty structures is warranted. The scope of this study is to provide an analysis of our proposed royalty standard & ERC 2981.\n\nVI.

Integrating Machine Learning (ML) aims to predict arbitrage occurrences in advance for faster trade execution, a tactic overlooked by many traders.

Results show Random Forest predicting exploitable arbitrage intervals ahead for Ether, with ML models more effective during less volatile periods. However, careful consideration is needed as predictions may not always align with market realities, leading to mixed trading outcomes.

When dealing with substantial amounts, such as hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, relying solely on bid and ask prices to determine transaction costs is inadequate. This approach fails to account for market depth, meaning that the liquidity available at the prices quoted by exchange APIs may represent only a fraction of the market. As a result, the actual execution price for significant orders, such as selling or buying assets worth a million dollars, can deviate markedly from the quoted prices. This discrepancy could dramatically alter the perceived profitability of arbitrage opportunities. \n\n3. The authors should address the practical constraints of arbitrage trading between two exchanges, such as the inability to instantaneously transfer funds from one platform to another and the potential fees associated with depositing and withdrawing funds.

                "The authors aim to apply machine learning techniques to predict arbitrage occurrences for BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT pairs on centralized exchanges in advance for faster trade execution and profitability. The authors perform extensive parameter search on four different types of ML models, and different prediction time interval. The results show that Random Forest is able to predict exploitable arbitrage minutes ahead in less volatile pairs, specifically ETH-USDT, with high accuracy and recall. The authors also observe a reduction in ML model performance when applied to highly volatile pairs, where arbitrage can happen more frequently.\nIn Section I and II, basic concepts of centralized exchanges, arbitrage and types of ML models are introduced, providing background material for this paper. The potential application of ML in exploiting more arbitrage opportunities is hypothesized. However, there are several definitions missing. 1) Efficiency of market and why it is important: if market is efficient, prices at any time perfectly reflect all available information, and there should be no arbitrage opportunities; 2) volatility of crypto currency is not defined (historical or implied?); 3) Need proper reference and justification for the argument in II.A: the prices of Bitcoin in terms of USDT reflects the current global economic situation.\nIn Section III, several prior works on ML in predicting arbitrage opportunities are discussed. The authors argue that there is a lack of validation and little focus of machine learning prediction in these works, justifying the potential value of this paper.\nIn Section IV, the authors discuss bid-ask spread and transaction fees, but in the actual dataset construction and prediction, only OHLCV (open, high, low, close and traded volumes) are used. It would be beneficial to incorporate bid-ask price and spread in prediction. Or if these features are used, more details on how they are used should be given.\nIn Section V and VI, extensive parameter selections and model evaluations are performed, justifying the performance of Random Forest model in accurately predicting arbitrage opportunities in advance under a 5-minute time interval. The author also concluded with the plots and results that less volatile cryptocurrencies create fewer arbitrage opportunities and lower profit, but higher predictability. In Table I and Table VII, it is not clear how the percentage change is calculated, and what values the columns \"Binance, Bybit, Total\" represent. It would be better to show both the values across a timewindow to show the percentage change. The authors show some difference of their finding with previous works, but the argument for the originality is not sufficiently justified.\nIn Section VII, the authors concludes and proposes future directions. The authors argue that the key novelty of the work lies in the demonstration of the profitability of the prediction one-time interval head. However, it does not directly connects the ML techniques the authors have used. If the authors could investigate the solutions for more volatile currencies, this work would be more intriguing and widely adoptable, since there are more volatile cryptocurrency pairs than stable ones.\n\nLanguage and format issues:\n- The authors tend to use long sentences which cause confusions.

One of them is arbi- trage, which is based on obtaining profit from price discrepancies between exchanges or cryptocurrency pairs. This way of trading is nothing new, but it occurs sporadically between fiat currencies. Due to the youth of the cryptocurrency market and the variety of pairs available, an exploitable arbitrage opportunity can develop more often, providing a higher percentage of potential profit [ 1 ]. To ensure that the profit is captured, the whole process has to be executed simultaneously and frequently [ 2 ], making this strategy unfeasible for humans and thus requiring an arbitrage bot to be implemented. This algorithmic trading method extracts data from a chosen cryptocurrency exchange via its API and available endpoints, providing requested data in JSON or XML format [ 3 ]. To provide a more detailed explanation of the arbitrage procedure, it can be described as constantly selling or buying cryptocurrency assets of one exchange or as a part of one pair and simultaneously selling or buying it on the other exchange before the profit disappears [ 4 ]. As many arbitrage bots create a competitive environment, imple- menting Machine Learning (ML) models can represent a valuable advantage when trying to predict the occurrence of profitable oppor- tunities in advance. Prediction in the field of cryptocurrencies could possibly profit from the implementation of the following algorithms [ 5 ]:\n\n\u2022 Logistic Regression - classification model that estimates a rela- tionship between a binary outcome and a dataset consisting of any number of independent variables [ 6 ],\n\n\u2022 Random Forest - algorithm suitable for classification, as well as regression problems based on the average or the most frequently occurring output of the multiple decision trees that the Random Forest consists of [ 7 ], [ 8 ],\n\n\u2022 Support Vector Machine - classification model trying to fit an optimal line to separate observations belonging to different classes [ 9 ],\n\n\u2022 Multilayer Perceptron - as one of the simplest neural network implementations, it comprises layers of neurons where the information flows from input through hidden to output layer with corresponding weights to be learned [ 10 ].\n\nVarious ways of integrating the described ML algorithms were inspected to find the most profitable by experimenting with the time interval of the obtained data and the values of hyperparameters for each algorithm separately. The contribution of such implementation is particularly in immediate transactions, to capture the potential profit before it disappears. That is exactly what can be the main asset of this paper, speeding up the arbitrage search and resulting in more exploited opportunities compared to other trading bots. When ML algorithms can predict an exploitable arbitrage opportunity even before it happens, the purchase can be timed at the beginning of the considered time interval between the first ones to take full advantage of the profit.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nArbitrage is trading an asset in one market while concurrently making an opposite purchase in another at a different price [ 4 ]. These price discrepancies are typical of highly volatile, unstable, decentralized markets with low regulations. All conditions mentioned are met by cryptocurrency markets, supported by the emergence of multiple currencies and exchanges, providing a convenient way of trading with the possibility to algorithmize the whole process. To minimize the risk of this strategy, small transactions are performed at higher periodicity, providing lower but more stable profit [ 1 ], [ 2 ]. The reasons for the arbitrage opportunity can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Efficiency of the market, which is maturing over time but still providing a vast amount of profitable arbitrages [ 11 ],\n\n\u2022 Price variations across exchanges cause the price to move away from the average price defined by market volume [ 11 ],\n\n\u2022 The currency spread, or the difference between the bid and ask price, expresses the contrast in willingness to buy or sell a specific asset [ 12 ],\n\n\u2022 Specific patterns, considering the impact of the time of the day, liquidity, or exchange heists and hacks [ 11 ].\n\nThere is no general approach to arbitrage spotting, as many aspects can play a significant role. It is advised that trading between exchanges, and specifically Bitcoin for other assets, may be more\n\nbeneficial [ 13 ]. Some arbitrage opportunities might occur due to a market crash, but those are rare [ 14 ]. The better principle seems to be reliance on the decentralized nature of Blockchain technology, which makes the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies feasible and supports the emergence of exploitable arbitrages [ 15 ].\n\nA. Bitcoin & Ether\n\nCryptocurrencies bring a new dimension to trading. They are becoming more convenient and popular due to their decentralized and immutable nature [ 3 ]. As a result, many cryptocurrencies evolved, but only a small amount became popular worldwide and had high trading volume. This paper aims to examine cryptocurrencies with high volatility and many executed transactions. Due to these requirements, Bitcoin and Ether are considered the best possibilities, with USDT (Tether) as their quote asset. Bitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency measured by its market capitalization. It was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous developer known by his pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The rise in price and popularity was dramatic, especially between 2016 and 2021, when the number of people possessing Bitcoin rose from 5 to over 220 million people. The value developed from the starting price of 1$ in February 2011 up to 69000$ in November 2021 [ 16 ]. As another example, Ether was used as the second-largest cryptocurrency, still with significant market capitalization. Its prices spiked in November 2021 to more than 4600$ [ 17 ]. Both cryptocurrencies mentioned are traded against USDT. Instead of fiat currency, Tether represents a stablecoin that offers more stability and lower volatility, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies. This can be achieved by pegging to nonvolatile underlying assets such as the USDollar and still relying on distributed ledger technology [ 18 ]. Thus, bringing more stability into cryptocurrency trading while keeping trades only between cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are gaining popularity and are beneficial for this paper as well.\n\nB. Cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where cryptocurrencies can be traded conveniently and quickly, represent a gateway between crypto and fiat currencies [ 19 ]. With the number of cryptocurrencies rising, the number of exchanges is also rising, making it an extensive resource for arbitrages to occur [ 3 ]. Connecting to an exchange via API is necessary to algorithmize the trading process. This paper uses Binance and Bybit exchanges to spot arbitrage possibilities between them. Binance is currently the world\u2019s leading Blockchain ecosystem, providing the core infrastruc- ture services for organizing the largest digital asset exchange [ 20 ]. Based on the volume traded at exchanges metric, Bybit is the second largest exchange. With similar goals but less widespread among users, Bybit is used to profit from price discrepancies between these two exchanges. Both exchanges are accessed via their API endpoints summarized in their corresponding documentation to provide an implementation of algorithmic trading to the public [ 21 ], [ 22 ]. For the purposes of this study, some liquidity of all traded assets must also be available on Binance and Bybit. Consequently, no deposit or withdrawal fees are considered to maximize the potential profit and avoid losing the entire arbitrage opportunity on transaction fees.\n\nIII. RELATED WORK\n\nVarious studies are dedicated to arbitrage bot trading on the cryptocurrency market. Only a small number of them are trying to promote the strategy by using ML algorithms to predict a profitable arbitrage opportunity even before it occurs.\n\nAccording to T. G. Fischer et al. [ 5 ], implementing Logistic Re- gression or Random Forest could be beneficial. The paper highlights that the most significant impact is determined by the minute-binned price, volume obtained, and the highest market capitalization of the considered cryptocurrencies to reflect the market\u2019s volatility and meet the minimal liquidation criteria. The choice of ML algorithms is mainly about comparing transparent and black-box approaches. The results have shown that Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression in every metric utilized to measure profitability. The paper by Madan, I. et al. [ 23 ] is dedicated to Bitcoin price predictions and focuses on the relevance of available cryptocurrency features. Again, choosing an ML algorithm does not play a crucial role. However, many different features are collected, considering mainly the number of transactions or blocks, transaction fees, or traded volume. For the price movement prediction, Binomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine were im- plemented and trained on price data for various time intervals. The outcomes favor Binomial Logistic Regression when working with daily data and Random Forest for intraday price data collection. Other relevant solutions include various arbitrage bots whose goal is to algorithmize trading strategies sensitive to the exact timing of transactions. Although they do not include any ML strategy, the procedure of arbitrage search and calculation of potential profit is identical. It represents an inspiration and verification method for the bot implemented within this paper. Specifically, there is FreqTrade, which represents a universal trading bot with the possibility to specify one\u2019s own trading strategy. Furthermore, this work also contains techniques of Artificial Intelligence summarized in the FreqAI framework, providing possibilities to test and compare various time-series forecasting methods on cryptocurrency price data that are mostly chaotic and, at first glance, unpredictable [ 24 ]. One of many solutions for a simple arbitrage bot without any ML principles included provides a clear understanding of the execution process of an arbitrage bot when trading on the futures market and represents a valuable verification of the bot\u2019s functionality [ 25 ].\n\nIV. SOLUTION DESIGN\n\nTo perform algorithmic arbitrage trading, an arbitrage bot has to be implemented. As summed up in III , many arbitrage bots allow users to algorithmize the whole process of an arbitrage strategy. To differentiate from the rivals waiting for the limited amount of exploitable arbitrages, ML models are trained and included in the arbitrage bot to predict the occurrence of a profitable arbitrage even before it arises. The bot is represented via a Python script that executes arbitrages between two exchanges, namely Binance and Bybit. To be able to obtain price data and perform necessary operations, the bot is connected to both exchanges via their APIs 1 . The bot is searching for exploitable arbitrage opportunities for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT cryptocurrency pairs continuously until its execution is terminated. The search is performed on the futures market as a limit order, which protects the user even more in this mostly risk-less trading strategy because the trade is not executed immediately; instead, it is waiting for the market to meet the desired price. The high-level architecture of the execution is provided in Figure 1 and provides two approaches when searching for arbitrage opportunities. One comprises a bare calculation of the potential profit, and the other takes advantage of ML integration. In both cases, the\n\n1 Format of queries is inspired by the following repositories: https://github.com/CryptoFacilities/REST-v3- Python/blob/master/cfRestApiV3.py, https://github.com/bybit-exchange/api- usage-examples/blob/master/V3 demo/api demo/contract/Encryption HMAC.py\n\ncurrent price data are gathered from both exchanges; the difference is when an arbitrage is assumed to occur. When a chosen algorithm is included, the execution is postponed by the time interval specified by the used dataset. Otherwise, the corresponding trades are executed immediately to capture the profit.\n\nFig. 1. Architecture\n\nTo decide whether a purchase should be executed, the potential profit of the transaction sequence must be calculated. The current stage of the order book and transaction fees on both exchanges must be considered when considering profit in arbitrage trading. The calculation process consists of obtaining the traded amount of the base asset, getting the price difference defined by the bid-ask spread, and deducting transaction fees. To keep transaction fees as low as possible, all traded assets are held on both exchanges; thus, no transactions between exchanges are necessary, and naturally, no withdrawal or deposit fees are included. The calculation proceeds as follows [ 25 ]: Traded amount of base asset\n\n\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 /(( 1 + \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 ) \u2217 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 ) (1)\n\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b ( \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 ) (2)\n\nwhere:\n\n\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 = amount available on the bid side of the order book \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 = amount available on the ask side of the order book \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52 = amount of base assets available in the portfolio \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 = amount of quote assets available in a portfolio \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = transaction fee of exchange where buying \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 = ask price from the order book\n\nTransaction fees\n\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \u2217 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \u2217 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 (3)\n\nwhere:\n\n\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f = transaction fee as a percentage of the trade \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 = traded amount of a base asset \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 = ask price \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 = bid price\n\nPotential profit\n\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = |( \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 \u2212 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 ) \u2217 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 | \u2212 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 (4)\n\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 / \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 \u2217 100 (5)\n\nwhere:\n\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58 = ask price \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 = bid price \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 = traded amount of a base asset \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = transaction fee of exchange where buying \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = percentage expression of profit\n\nBesides the described bot\u2019s execution, all ML integration steps must be performed. Specifically, consisting of gathering data from both exchanges, data cleaning and pre-processing, visualization of the datasets, data normalization, and building the models for all algorithms with evaluation and comparison of them based on the accuracy metrics. Datasets used to train models consist of price data, specifically OHLCV data, consisting of open, high, low, close, and trading volume for the corresponding datetime. Various time intervals are tested, namely 1, 5, and 15 minutes, to find the interval that best reflects the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility. The data are gathered for half a year to spot current trends in the market uninfluenced by the historical development of the currency. The datasets are gathered for Binance and Bybit separately to simulate the potential arbitrages in the past. As a part of the pre-processing, deletion of null values, handling of extreme outliers, and composition and appending of features representing change and arbitrage are executed. The change rep- resents the percentage movement of the currency since the last collected observation. Arbitrage possibilities are expressed by 1 or 0, representing whether the observations from both exchanges for the specific datetime could form an exploitable arbitrage.\n\nV. IMPLEMENTATION ANDE VALUATION\n\nThe arbitrage bot was implemented as proposed, continuously searching for arbitrage opportunities at 1-minute intervals. To perform the required operations, connection to the APIs of both exchanges is established via an API and secret keys corresponding to the created accounts. We have provided all source codes and datasets on GitHub 2 . The financial profit obtained strongly depends on the current stage of the cryptocurrency markets and world economics, seasonality, and time of day. The profitability of the bot was measured from the day 29.04.2023 07:20 until 12.05.2023 07:00, where the price of Bitcoin on Binance fluctuated from 29201 . 1 to 27846 and on Bybit from 29392 . 5 to 26000 and the price of Ether on Binance from 1897 to 1860 . 9 and on Bybit from 1901 . 7 to 1769 . 65 . The overall change in the portfolio is displayed in Table I , resulting in a 32 . 11 % change in the total balance of USDT on both exchanges. The success of the arbitrage bot is measured for all assets on both exchanges, the Binance column expresses the liquidity of the assets on the Binance exchange and similarly the liquidity is provided for the Bybit exchange. The assets are summed across all exchanges as no withdrawal or deposit transaction is executed to maximise the potential profit. This total liquidity of assets is then used as a measure of the arbitrage bot\u2019s total profit. The percentage change represents the rise (or potentially decline) of the total amount of USDT on both exchanges when compared to the portfolio stage before and after the run of the arbitrage bot. When expressed in monetary values, the total amount of USDT rose from 26364 . 721 to 34830 . 39 . As a result of trading on the futures market, the total balance of BTC and ETH was not changed. As already mentioned and also proven by the visualized execution, the arbitrage trading strategy results in profit when the purchases and sells are repeated in a longer period of time without any interruptions. Including ML models required data gathering, data visualization, and data pre-processing. The obtained datasets consisted of OHLCV data with a corresponding timestamp and traded volume for a half year, specifically from 22.9.2022 until 23.3.2023. Datasets were obtained for each traded pair from both exchanges and for 1, 5, and 15 minutes. As a part of pre-processing, datasets were cleaned from\n\n2 https://github.com/fiit-ba/ML-for-arbitrage-in-cryptoexchanges\n\nTABLEI PORTFOLIO WITHOUTML\n\nAsset Binance Bybit Total Percentage change\n\nBTC 0.045 1.000 1.045 0.000%\n\nETH 0.637 0.542 1.179 0.000%\n\nUSDT 17867.600 16962.790 34830.390 32.11%\n\nnull values and extreme outliers determined by the values out of the 0 . 001 and 0 . 999 quantile range. Later, datasets were merged to pursue a congruent traded pair and time interval. Furthermore, the percentage change between two open prices in a row and the identification of arbitrage between exchanges for open and close prices and combinations of high and low prices were appended to the datasets. As a part of the visualization, prices on both exchanges, overall traded volume, and change on exchanges were visualized. Figure 2 shows the development of open prices and signifies that most price fluctuations resulting in arbitrage opportuni- ties originate on the Bybit exchange. The quantity of specified ranges of traded volume from both exchanges visualized in Figure 3 proves that in most of the intervals, the traded volume stays very low, and Figure 4 supports the price fluctuations visible from comparisons of open prices as well. To enrich the arbitrage search, ML models were trained. Specifi- cally, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron. The training of each model consisted of gradual testing of individual hyperparameters and subsequently training the model with the best parameters and determining which time interval suits the process of predicting arbitrage the best. Due to the higher number of hyperparameters, large datasets for small time intervals, and negligible differences in individual tests, the set of all possible values for hyperparameters was not searched exhaustively. All tested hyperparameters for each ML algorithm, with the chosen one highlighted, are summarized in Tables II , III , IV and V . The gathered results based on the proportion of accuracy and F1 score with the most suitable time interval for each cryptocurrency pair are summarized in Table VI . Subsequently, due to better results, the model for the prediction of ETHUSDT was included in the execution of the arbitrage bot, and the profitability was measured again on the day 15.05.2023 11:56 until 20.05.2023 11:31, where the price of Ether from Binance fluctuated from 1860 . 9 to 1861 . 1 and on Bybit from 1828 . 37 to 1813 . 82 . The overall change in the portfolio is displayed in Table VII , resulting in a 0 . 455 % change in the total balance of USDT on both exchanges, with the same meaning of the column values as in the previous portfolio table. As can be seen from the obtained results, the profit gain is insignificant, indicating the trained model\u2019s carefulness. However, a still profitable result was observed, which suggests a valuable resource for arbitrage search when the cryptocurrency market matures, and the occurrence of exploitable arbitrage becomes even rare with a higher number of trading bots fighting for limited profit. Although these results have to be compared carefully due to the different time ranges of the execution, namely 13 and 5 days, caused by a shortage of time, the results still provide sufficient evidence of the profitability of both modifications of the arbitrage bot.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nThe results of the training of ML models signify a relationship between OHLCV price data of a cryptocurrency pair, traded volume, percentage change, and the occurrence of exploitable arbitrage. When considering the differences between individual ML models, the best\n\nTABLEII HYPERPARAMETERS FORL OGISTICR EGRESSION\n\nLogistic Regression penalty l1 l2\n\nC 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\nmax iter 500 1000 1500\n\nTABLEIII HYPERPARAMETERS FORR ANDOMF OREST\n\nRandom Forest n estimators 50 100 150\n\ncriterion gini entropy\n\nmin samples split 2 10 50\n\nmax features sqrt log2 None\n\nbootstrap True\n\nresults were obtained from Random Forest, but being aware of the potential overfitting and thus preferring a 5-minute time interval, as a 1-minute interval is prone to learning the dataset by heart. The main difference was identified between the considered cryptocurrency pairs. The more volatile ones are much harder to predict regardless of the time interval. As Figure 2 shows, the pair ETHUSDT is much more stable for the selected time range of the dataset, resulting in sig- nificantly better results for all considered metrics for the implemented models. On the other hand, less volatile cryptocurrencies create fewer arbitrage opportunities, resulting in lower available profit. When all combined, Random Forest for a 5-minute time interval and trained on the ETHUSDT cryptocurrency pair leads to the best evaluation with the accuracy of 0 . 985 , precision of 0 . 635 , recall of 0 . 836 , and an F1 score of 0 . 722 . The paper focused on integrating ML algorithms into an arbitrage trading strategy between cryptocurrency exchanges. From all the models described above, Random Forest performed the best when used for a 5-minute time interval in the dataset. When integrated into a real trading strategy, the approaches with and without the inclusion of the ML model were compared, resulting in a profit of 32 . 11 % without and 0 . 455 % with the ML model. Although these results were obtained during different time ranges, both numbers support the profitable modifications to the implemented arbitrage bot. Compared with related work, the obtained results were similar in some aspects but different in others. Equally, to T. G. Fischer et al. [ 5 ], Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression; however, with datasets consisting of nearly the same price data, it thrived better\n\nTABLEIV HYPERPARAMETERS FORS UPPORTV ECTORM ACHINE\n\nSupport Vector Machine C 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\npenalty l1 l2\n\nmax iter 500 1000 1500\n\nkernel linear\n\nTABLEV HYPERPARAMETERS FORM ULTILAYERP ERCEPTRON\n\nMultilayer Perceptron activation logistic relu tanh\n\nsolver sgd adam\n\nlearning rate init 0,001 0.01 0.1\n\nmax iter 100 150 200\n\nhidden layer sizes (5, 5)\n\nFig. 2.

The prices are collected with different time intervals, namely 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals from the two exchanges, Binance and Bybit. The individual graphs compare the open prices from both exchanges for one cryptocurrency pair and one-time intervals to visualize the price difference and show potentially profitable arbitrage.\n\nTABLEVI MLMODELS\n\nML model Cryptocurrency Time interval Accuracy Precision Recall F1 score\n\nLogistic Regression BTCUSDT 1 minute 0.981 0.135 0.814 0.232\n\nETHUSDT 1 minute 0.975 0.433 0.963 0.597\n\nRandom Forest BTCUSDT 5 minutes 0.985 0.284 0.617 0.389\n\nETHUSDT 5 minutes 0.985 0.635 0.836 0.722\n\nSupport Vector Machine BTCUSDT 1 minute 0.986 0.179 0.793 0.292\n\nETHUSDT 1 minute 0.974 0.426 0.965 0.591\n\nMultilayer Perceptron BTCUSDT 1 minute 0.984 0.175 0.899 0.292\n\nETHUSDT 5 minutes 0.973 0.466 0.864 0.605\n\nTABLEVII PORTFOLIO WITHML\n\nAsset Binance Bybit Total Percentage change\n\nBTC 0.045 1.000 1.045 0.000%\n\nETH 0.637 0.316 0.953 0.000%\n\nUSDT 17986.879 17002.060 34888.939 0.455%\n\nwith a 5-minute interval in comparison to the 1-minute interval from the related work. Similarly, Madan et al. [ 23 ] considered Random Forest one of the more successful models with Logistic Regression, whose results were not that influential in this paper. This difference could be explained by the diametrically different features and time intervals considered. In general, it is evident that Random Forest could reflect the price features gathered in the datasets with the best results measured by various ML metrics.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION ANDF UTUREW ORK\n\nTo sum up, it was demonstrated that combining ML algorithms and an arbitrage trading strategy between cryptocurrency exchanges\n\ncan provide interesting outcomes. Multiple ML models with multiple parameters were tested. Random Forest with a 5-minute time interval provided the best result for both considered cryptocurrency pairs: BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT. Both approaches to arbitrage trading with and without the inclusion of ML algorithms were tested and provided profitable results. The key novelty of the paper is the demonstration of the profitability of the prediction of exploitable arbitrage one-time intervals beforehand, making it a valuable resource to outrun the rivals represented by an increasing number of existing arbitrage bots.\n\nFurthermore, to obtain the maximal relationships from the datasets, the possibility of arbitrage occurrence appended to the dataset could be replaced by an actual observation of whether trades leading to arbitrage were executed by obtaining a historical order book from the involved exchanges. Such an analysis of data could lead to more precise results, even in volatile crypto markets. The inclusion of less- known, more unstable currencies could also influence the results due to the frequent occurrence of arbitrage possibilities, making it harder to predict exploitable arbitrages. Implementing more complex neural networks could be beneficial for revealing the relationships\n\nFig. 3. The amount of volume traded for two cryptocurrency pairs, BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT, for three different time intervals: 1, 5, and 15 minutes. The volumes traded on the two exchanges, Binance and Bybit, are added together. The individual graphs show that most transactions transacted are of lower volume. This fact corresponds to the nature of the arbitrage trading strategy, which aligns with the current state of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFig. 4. The arbitrage opportunities and the calculation of the change between two consecutive absolute values of open prices. The higher this change becomes, the more likely there is an arbitrage opportunity to take advantage of unaligned price changes in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nbetween the features in the datasets. Our plan is to focus on arbitrage predictions on DEXs, promising more opportunities available.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Contract no.

        "body": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nMost of us are already familiar with Bitcoin [1]. It was proposed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and, in 2013, started to be traded on exchanges. Once Bitcoin became more popular, it started to attract investors due to price hikes. Even some of the now well-known cryptocurrencies derived from Bitcoin at the beginning. Many studies analyzed if there is the possibility of \ufb01nding a correlation between Market prices, Bitcoin price, and sentiment (from social media for example). The study by Bouri et al. [2] conducted research on this topic and found that there is a slight correlation between the price movement of Bitcoin and some other related cryptocurrencies. This, however, is becoming less relevant as the market is now more spread and Bitcoin\u2019s margin is slowly evening out with other popular cryptocurrencies (eg. Ethereum [3]). As ElBahrawy et al. [4] con\ufb01rm - Bitcoin has been steadily losing its advantage over other runner-up cryptocurrencies. According to [5], the vast majority of research is focused on Bitcoin, however, there are also studies that focus on a broader scale of the market [6]. This paper does not focus on speci\ufb01c cryptocurrencies in general. It proposes a universal solution to many cryptocurrency pairs. The paper also does not study cryptocurrency prices. It rather focuses on event changes and event predictions based on data received from important market makers and sentiment from X tweets. There are two different kinds of market makers:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity provider - Used in classic \ufb01at or crypto exchanges, holds a large number of shares. They can move with the market prices. Some Liquidity providers sell their data and it can be used for predicting future changes.\n\n\u2022 Automated market maker (AMM) - As mentioned in [7], AMMs are an essential part of DeFi (Decentralized \ufb01nance) and Dex (Decentralized Exchange) protocols/applications. They allow for exchange without any counterparty by creating liquidity pools made of lots of participants. These operate on cryptocurrency exchanges from which there are also two different kinds:\n\n\u2022 Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) - Governed by a centralized entity. Famous for the incident with FTX [8]. Many people start to lose trust and interest in this kind of exchange.\n\n\u2022 Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX) - Fully decen- tralized exchanges that are not operated by a single entity and are not controllable beyond what the community wants to change. Much more reliable than centralized exchanges, but they can bring some other problems too. Similar to centralized exchanges, one has to trust a speci\ufb01c exchange and be sure that it is not a scam. These exchanges use many sophisticated models so that exchange can be controlled by a decentralized autonomous organization based e.g., on the already mentioned AMMs.\n\nEvery exchange uses so-called \u201dOrder books\u201d that are lists of buy and sell commands. The study by Barbon et al. [9] compares the quality of CEX to DEX. They found out that Binance, which is a centralized exchange, scored the best among a trio of Kraken and Uniswap. An interesting point made by researchers is, that Uniswap could have had the best gas fees when it came to transaction cost testing. This, however, was only on the level of assumption because Ethereum awaited an upgrade to the proof of stake consensus mechanism at the time testing was performed. Because of that, real fee results were best for Binance.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nCryptocurrency trading demands a considerable amount of time and attention. The market \ufb02uctuates constantly, with prices changing every minute. According to [10], the cryptocurrency market is one of the most volatile and fastest-growing markets. Traders need to react swiftly to every price movement to avoid \ufb01nancial losses and maximize their pro\ufb01ts. However, for human traders, it can be challenging to keep up with every change in the market and evaluate them to make informed decisions. To tackle this, traders rely on strategies to evaluate the changes in the market based on the data received from the market. Once they have analyzed the data, they must apply their evaluations to the market broker application. This process could take several seconds, if not minutes, for a human trader to complete. Consequently, traders would have to be online 24 hours a day to avoid missing out on any signi\ufb01cant market events [11]. Thankfully, trading bots have emerged as an effective solution to evaluate market changes and upcoming events in a matter of milliseconds. These bots analyze the market data and send signals to the trader\u2019s account in the market broker, indicating when to open or close positions, set take pro\ufb01ts, or stop losses. According to [12], there have been numerous neural networks developed to predict the prices of cryptocurrencies. Most of them focus on Bitcoin. The study [13] also focuses on predicting the regime changes of Bitcoin. They use the hidden Markov model for the classi\ufb01cation of three different regimes. Stable, intermediate, and volatile. As [5] mentions, traders focus on predictability rather than prices going up or down. This is the major reason behind the development of prediction algorithms and prediction models. According to [14], the most widely used techniques for the prediction\n\nof the market are arti\ufb01cial intelligence, support vector machines, and random forests. Through the constant updates provided by a variety of other soft- ware tools (Telegram, RabbitMQ), traders can stay informed about the trading bot\u2019s activity, even when they are away from their computers. Overall, trading bots have signi\ufb01cantly reduced the time and effort required to trade in the crypto exchange, enabling traders to maximize their pro\ufb01ts while minimizing their risks. One of the interesting solutions mentioned in [15] uses stochastic neural networks to build models for predicting the prices of different cryptocurrencies. They claim that their solution, on average, brings 1.56% improvement on a dataset they selected. Another similar solution worth mentioning [16] uses machine learning techniques to predict the market. They tried three machine algorithms to predict changes in Bitcoin price movement. It was discovered that the ARIMAX algorithm brought the best result, while FBProp and XGBoost were far off compared to ARIMAX. They stated, that it could be improved even further with parameter hypertunning.\n\nIII. DESIGN\n\nThe initial work and development of ideal strategies consisted of a good analysis of historical data from the market maker. For this case, we used a neural network LSTM [17] as the model architecture. The dataset used for training contains 434,237 rows and 19 columns. The data does not have null values but has NaN values between the columns (column price and smallestDelta applies only to event liquidity). This was a necessity to solve because of data transformation. After the model was trained, we received predictions that we could apply to \ufb01ne-tune our strategies. The work\ufb02ow of the initial analysis is explained in Figure 1.\n\nFig. 1. Analysis work\ufb02ow\n\nThe data we analyzed contain the following events:\n\n\u2022 \u201dliquidityLineCreated\u201d signalizes that a zone with liquidity has been detected and this shows the price. Represents where liquidity should be left. The zones represent moments when market makers are about to sell some stock.\n\n\u2022 \u201dliquidityLineReached\u201d signalizes that the price has reached an existing liquidity zone\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneStart\u201d signalizes that a zone preceding a price correction has been created\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneExit\u201d signalizes that a zone has been broken and price correction may happen. (This will be indicated when a price will start a movement.)\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneExpansion\u201d signalizes that the zone has turned into an oscillation range, where the price may swing around the fair price\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneContraction\u201d signalizes that zone being created (after the start and before exit) just got more narrow\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneTentative\u201d signalizes a high possibility a zone will be created soon\n\n\u2022 \u201dzoneRangeExit\u201d signalizes that the price has left the zone and it is possible it will not come to return to the same position; the zoneRangeExit is when the price has moved signi\ufb01cantly and the in\ufb02uence of the zone, on the price returning, will start diminishing\n\n\u2022 \u201dfairPriceCross\u201d signalizes that the price has crossed the fair price\n\n\u2022 \u201dfairPrice\u201d (\u201dmiddle\u201d) represents the price around which we expect the price to oscillate until the market maker decides to make a price correction. There are a few scenarios depending on whether the price oscillates around them, or stays on one side.\n\nAfter we understood all events we analyzed relationships between the selected pairs of attributes. We identi\ufb01ed dependencies between pairs of attributes and dependencies between the predicted variable and other variables. There were several positive correlations:\n\n\u2022 low + high - correlation 1, which can be related to similar values, if high grows, so does low and below\n\n\u2022 low + rangeLow - in this case we do not yet understand the rangeLow parameter as it relates to low\n\n\u2022 low + rangeHigh - in this case we do not yet understand the rangeHigh parameter and how it is related to low\n\n\u2022 low + range\n\n\u2022 low + middle - correlation 1\n\n\u2022 high + rangeHigh - lower correlation than with low + rangeHigh\n\n\u2022 high + rangeLow - lower correlation than with low + rangeLow\n\n\u2022 high + range - greater correlation than low + range\n\n\u2022 high + middle - correlation 1\n\n\u2022 rangeHigh + rangeLow - almost 1\n\n\u2022 rangeHigh + range\n\n\u2022 rangeHigh + middle\n\n\u2022 rangeLow + range - lower than rangeHigh + range\n\n\u2022 rangeLow + middle - identical to rangeHigh + middle\n\n\u2022 price + smallestDelta - for event liquidityLineCreated\n\nThe Figure 2 of the heat map of correlations below explains this further. For each column of the table, we \ufb01rst get the event type. These then get grouped the values of individual events into a matrix according to the type of event. In the case of deep learning, it is necessary to \ufb01rst edit the data into such a form that it is possible to train a neural network. We \ufb01rst extracted the required information from the data in our experiments. Then we created a new dataset from the extracted pieces of information. Replacing the missing values is a crucial step. The deep learning model can not have missing pieces of information. Boolean values in the modi\ufb01ed dataset are transformed into integer values. Next, we selected nine interesting columns with which we continued working with. We also\n\nFig. 2. Heatmap of correlations\n\ntransformed eight different events into a numerical form. Rescaling these numerical values is a good practice for training neural networks. Algorithm 1 shows the process of transforming the dataset.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Transform data Require: extracted data from market makers\u2019 data\ufb02ow DEnsure: transformed data Y\n\n1: Fill missing values in D . 2: for each column y \u2208D do 3: if y is Boolean then\n\n4: transform y to Integer\n\n5: end if\n\n6: if y has lo w as value then\n\n7: y \u2190 0\n\n8: end if\n\n9: if y has hi g h as value then\n\n10: y \u2190 1\n\n11: end if\n\n12: if y is e v ent then\n\n13: code y values as Integer\n\n14: end if\n\n15: end for\n\nFor our solution, we used the type of recurrent neural network LSTM. According to [18] - \u201dLSTMs are predominantly used for learning, processing, and classi\ufb01cation of sequential data because these networks can learn long-term dependencies between time steps of the data.\u201d The \ufb01nal architecture for our solution consists of 4 layers of 32 neurons, and as an activation function, we use the ReLU function after each layer. To avoid over\ufb01tting, we use a dropout level of 0.2, which means we turn off 20% of the neurons in each layer.\n\nWe have eight input features during training, while our model generates event predictions as an output. During the experiments, we tried different numbers of epochs during training. For the \ufb01nal experiment, we chose 50 epochs, while the learning rate, in this case, was 0.001. The loss function is Mean Square Error, which is suitable for predictions, and we used Adam as the optimizer. If the value of Loss decreases, the model is learning. The data must be further divided into training, validation and testing sets. In the case of the validation and test set, we combined the data in different ways to avoid over-learning. The test set is the data the model has not seen, thus serving as the \ufb01nal prediction. Algorithm 2 shows the training of our deep learning model. Validation is done the same, but updating parameters and gradients is skipped.\n\nAlgorithm 2 Training model Require: number of epochs E , input features X , target YEnsure: trained model\n\n1: for each epoch \u2208E do 2: for each x , y \u2208X , Y in random order do\n\n3: calculate the gradient\n\n4: train LSTM model\n\n5: calculate \u02c6 y\n\n6: calculate the loss function\n\n7: perform an optimization step\n\n8: end for\n\n9: end for\n\nAfter initial analysis with a neural network, we gained enough promising results to start work on the solution itself. The solution works with data from in\ufb02uential market makers and Twitter. Market\n\nmaker data is de\ufb01ned by big organizations that have enough capital to move with the market and it consists of events, that signal their next actions. Our solution uses this data for setting take pro\ufb01t, stop losses, opening and closing positions. In some cases, we also rely on the current price of the cryptocurrency to make successful next steps. Our program consists of two separate processes.\n\n\u2022 First process contains the main strategy and fetches data from the market maker data stream. It also evaluates fetched data to create an optimal strategy.\n\n\u2022 Second process continuously fetches the current price from Binance API [19] and evaluates it with speci\ufb01c passed events. Both of these processes interact with a trader who receives orders from our solution right after event evaluation. It then performs op- erations with the market broker (for example Binance). Our solution can work with multiple cryptocurrency pairs at the same time. It can also have multiple trading accounts attached. There is a limitation to this currently. Every connected account can only listen to the same orders. It is planned to be resolved in future work. We designed our solution in Python programming language which is widely known for its ease of use and broad scale of use cases. The solution consists of two processes that have their own memory and processing power allocated separately. The \ufb01rst process listens on the RabbitMQ consumer channel (queue) for upcoming events from the market maker data stream. RabbitMQ [20] is an open-source message broker that is used by many enterprises. It supports multiple messaging protocols and can be deployed in distributed and federated con\ufb01gurations to meet high-scale and high availability requirements. Handling upcoming events consists of starting strategy with data received from the event and strategy runs several checks where attributes from events are compared with already opened positions and in case, the conditions are met, we open a new position. The last step if a new position is opened is sending the order to the trader. These orders are also saved in a database which consists of a few different tables.\n\n\u2022 Table for opened positions\n\n\u2022 Table for closed positions\n\n\u2022 Table for \u201dzoneStart\u201d events\n\n\u2022 Table for \u201dzoneExit\u201d events The \ufb01rst process also handles these events for multiple cryptocurrency pairs. The second process handles the current price of cryptocurrency pairs from Binance API. Its diagram can be found in the Figure 5. We fetch a new candle for a speci\ufb01c cryptocurrency pair and compare it to an associated opened positions in the database. This process also compares current price candles with some speci\ufb01c saved zone events in the database and in case of meeting conditions necessary to open a new position is opened. This is done by sending a signal to the trader through the RabbitMQ channel. Because we need to deal with multiple cryptocurrency pairs at the same time this process has to have multiple threads. As already mentioned solution uses RabbitMQ to fetch data from the market maker stream, which sends new upcoming events to our RabbitMQ receiver server. Its architecture is explained in Figure 3. Our solution then sends order signals to another remote RabbitMQ server responsible for making trades. The solution has two types of evaluating strategies.\n\n\u2022 First strategy is based on the evaluation of events called \u201dzon- eStart\u201d and \u201dzoneExit\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Second strategy is based on events called \u201dliquidityLineCreated\u201d and \u201dLiquidityLineReached\u201d. It is also known as the \u201dscalping\u201d strategy.\n\nIn the \ufb01rst strategy, we await an event that is called \u201dzoneStart\u201d. Once we receive such an event, the solution saves the event to the database and also looks for every opened position in it. If it is found, the solution moves it from the opened positions table to the table for closed positions. It then sends a close signal for every position through the RabbitMQ producer. This is done because we expect, that cryptocurrency will be moving horizontally until the \u201dzoneExit\u201d event. When the zone ends, the horizontal way will switch to the vertical way and that could mean potential risk for open positions as we do not know where will zone move. Positions are differentiated by the so-called \u201dposition-id\u201d. If we receive an event that is called \u201dzoneExit\u201d our solution just saves the event to the database for further use. The second strategy awaits \u201dliquidityLineReached\u201d events. Once received, the solution opens a new position and speci\ufb01es it as opened from \u201dliquidityLineReached\u201d for further use. The position is saved to the database and a signal containing the position id is sent to the trader. Stop-loss of this position is calculated for two scenarios in the following ways:\n\n\u2022 Long position \u2192 liquidit y LineReachedPrice \u00b7 0 . 90\n\n\u2022 Short position \u2192 liquidit y LineReachedPrice \u00b7 1 . 10\n\nThe type of position depends on the side of the \u201dliquidity- LineReached\u201d event. If the liquidity line that is reached is side \u201dHigh\u201d, we open a short position. On the other hand, if the event is side \u201dLow\u201d, we open a long position. The second type of event we look for in the second strategy is \u201dliquidityLineCreated\u201d. Once we receive that event we check every opened position from the event \u201dliquidityLineReached\u201d. The \u201dliq- uidityLineCreated\u201d event is for setting take pro\ufb01ts. It updates every position opened from \u201dliquidityLineReached\u201d and sets its take pro\ufb01ts to the price we received in \u201dliquidityLineCreated\u201d. LiquidityLines can be on both sides. If the side is \u201dLow\u201d then we set take pro\ufb01ts to short positions and if the side is \u201dHigh\u201d then take pro\ufb01ts is set to long positions. In the Figure 4, we can observe process 1 decision-making. As we can see, we are constantly fetching price candles from Binance API. We then compare every price candle with every opened position in the database. If the price candle matches the value in the column take pro\ufb01t or stop the loss of queried opened positions, if conditions are met we close the position by moving the selected position from open positions into closed positions. There is no signal to the trader in this case. In the second case, we check the database table \u201dpassed-zone- events\u201d, if there is an event \u201dzoneExit\u201d and there is no \u201dzoneStart\u201d afterward. If this is the case, it means, that the new zone has not yet started and we check for certain conditions:\n\n\u2022 We open long position if price is equal to hi g hSideO f ZoneExit + ( hi g hSideO f ZoneExit \u2212 lo w SideO f ZoneExit ) and \u201dexitSide\u201d is equal to \u201dHigh\u201d\n\n\u2022 We open short position if price is equal to lo w SideO f ZoneExit \u2212 ( hi g hSideO f ZoneExit \u2212 lo w SideO f ZoneExit ) and \u201dexitSide\u201d is equal to \u201dLow\u201d\n\nThese calculations are done to ensure that the price has a trend to go in a vertical way which we need. The \u201dzoneStart\u201d event opens the zone and the zone represents a horizontal way on the graph which by itself is not enough for good trading decisions. \u201dzoneExit\u201d represents the end of currently last zone and we can predict, that price will most likely oscillate into the vertical way. During our research, we discovered, that it is very ef\ufb01cient to be able to change strategy in real time if necessary. Changing\n\nFig. 3. RabbitMQArchitecture\n\nFig. 4. Process 1, decision diagram\n\ncertain calculation values, decisions in strategy or adjusting different conditions for opening and closing turned out to bring more pro\ufb01table outcomes. These strategies are tested in a special variation of our solution which does not operate with real money. To get broader results we also tried testing on historical data. Once the strategy proves to be pro\ufb01table we can deploy it to our solution which runs live. This is done with a speci\ufb01c GitHub pipeline that updates the source code on the server, then the script sends a block signal to the trader so no trades are being made. Once everything is stopped our solution applies an update automatically and restarts itself. The second important part of our solution is Twitter sentiment analysis. Before we can start pulling tweets we need to know which tweets from which accounts are relevant. The \ufb01rst important step was an analysis of accounts, that have in\ufb02uential posts regarding Blockchain as well as relevant hashtags. In hashtags we looked at popular Blockchain terms, checking if they are used on Twitter and if they are used with information regarding cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency market. From the comprehensive list we made, @elonmusk, @krakenfx and @Polkadot are a few, that we decided to mention. From hashtags, we decided to mention #Binance, #cryp- toAlerts and #DEFI. They proved to be among the most in\ufb02uential.\n\nFig. 5. Process 2, decision diagram\n\nWe have created two different Python scripts to pull tweets and each has its purpose:\n\n\u2022 The \ufb01rst script is used to fetch historical data\n\n\u2022 The second script is used to pull tweets from selected accounts and hashtags daily.\n\nPulling tweets happens in three cycles. The \ufb01rst cycle con- sists of pulling tweets from accounts. This cycle uses API call .user_timeline which allows for pulling the last 3200 tweets from selected accounts. The second cycle goes through all selected hashtags. This cycle uses API call search_tweets , which typi- cally allows for pulling tweets that are up to one week old. The third cycle uses the same API call as the second one, but this one pulls combinations of hashtags. Pairing multiple hashtags together could \ufb01lter out irrelevant data. Tweets are stored in \ufb01les with a \u201d.csv\u201d extension due to the limitations of our current system. In future work, we want to upgrade that storing mechanism to store data in the database. This database will consist of 4 columns that will contain the following:\n\n\u2022 Account name\n\nFig. 6. Predicted data\n\nFig. 7. Accuracy of model\n\n\u2022 Tweet\n\n\u2022 Timestamp\n\n\u2022 Hashtag used for search (Empty if the search is performed by account name instead of the hashtag)\n\nIV. TEST SCENARIOS\n\nTo fully test our solution before it is used with real \ufb01nances we designed two tests and a few simulations. These simulations are tested on historical data from the market maker for the year 2021. Another essential part is prices corresponding to speci\ufb01c times. These are pulled from Binance which provides API for historical data. Simulations consist of:\n\n\u2022 Process 1 consists of a RabbitMQ listener, that listens for upcoming events.\n\n\u2022 Process 2 fetches prices from the Binance API in an in\ufb01nity loop. After the price is fetched, our program sleeps for 0.5 seconds and the next timestamp is moved 5 minutes ahead\n\nand this loop is repeated with a new timestamp. Sleep delay is necessary to avoid Binance API parser timeout.\n\n\u2022 Process 3 is responsible for sending new events to the RabbitMQ listener running in Process 1. The process consists of a loop that parses the next event in the .csv test \ufb01le. It also checks the time stamp against the last saved price in the database. If they are approximately matching, we send an event to the RabbitMQ listener and continue to the next event.\n\nWe designed the following two tests:\n\n\u2022 Test 1 - Running solution for 19 days on historical data with fetching candle prices every 5 minutes\n\n\u2022 Test 2 - Running solution for 53 days on historical data with fetching candle prices every 5 minutes\n\nTests were designed to compare the short-term to long-term ef\ufb01ciency of our solution.\n\nFig. 8. Loss of model\n\nV. RESULTS\n\nData that are also worth mentioning are predicted data, the accu- racy of the model, and the loss of the model. These are from initial analysis and they can be seen in the Figures 6, 7, and 8. We ran two simulation tests to evaluate our solution and its pro\ufb01tability. As already mentioned \ufb01rst test was designed for the 19-day interval from 05.07.2023 to 23.07.2023. We noticed positive results in this time frame. The solution was able to trade up to 14% in pro\ufb01ts. In the second test, we let the simulation run in the time frame from 01.08.2023 to 19.10.2023. It successfully opened and closed 209 positions. The pro\ufb01tability of this test was higher. The solution was able to trade up to 39% in pro\ufb01ts. This diametrical difference shows us, that our solution pro\ufb01tability also depends on the time frame. In conclusion, our solution seems to be pro\ufb01table in both tests and time frames. The strategies could always be tuned to perform better however we found this to be the most optimal setup for now. The Figures 9, 10 show the results of both tests.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION ANDFUTURE WORK\n\nOur tests proved, that our model has promising results and can be pro\ufb01table in the both short and long term. This is due to research that was done to \ufb01ne-tune the strategies of our solution. These can always be improved even more. As for future work, we wish to improve in many aspects. In the case of evaluation, a metric for accuracy, we compare rescaled normalized actual event values and predicted values this could be researched more. Upon an LSTM deep learning model for predicting cryptocurrency events, we also started building an LSTM classi\ufb01er. Further experiments for searching the best depth and width and also hyper-parameters tuning will be done in the future. Promising results would also show if our model is reliable enough to be deployed on live data. From other limitations, our solution has, we wish to resolve the receiving of different orders for different accounts as currently, all accounts receive the same orders. Another future work would be creating a database for tweet pulling. This database would consist of four main columns as mentioned above in the design section. It would save space and make working with tweets a lot easier.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cBitcoin: APeer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d. en.

The core idea behind DeFi is that users performing various \ufb01nancial operations in a trust-less environment without relying on trusted third parties. One member of the DeFi ecosystem, the decentralized ex- change (DEX), has attracted exceptional adoption [1]. ADEX marketplace allows users to exchange assets directly without intermediaries. Despite their popularity, DEXes have a crucial \ufb02aw: frontrunning . Adversaries observe the content of public pending transactions and place competing orders before them to extract wealth from the traders. The ability to in\ufb02uence transaction execution order is one of the primary components of frontrunning. On Ethereum [2], block producers receive a portion of the transaction fees as a reward for their work. Therefore, the producers are incentivized to prioritize high-fee transactions. Frontrunners take advantage of the incentives. By paying a higher or lower fee than the victim, the frontrunners in\ufb02uence the transaction execution order in relation to the victim. Frontrunning on Ethereum is a well-studied topic in academia [3], [4], [5] and industry [6]. XRPLedger is one of the oldest well-established blockchains [7]. Unlike the Proof-of protocols used in Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRPLedger relies on a federated byzantine\n\nagreement protocol, where a group of validators vote to advance the ledger history. XRPLedger operates a Close Limit Order Book (CLOB) based DEX. In a CLOB, users issue buy and sell offers, and the blockchain matches these with existing ones at the best possible price. To protect the DEX against frontrunning, XRPLedger executes transactions in a pseudo-random order, or so-called Canonical Order [8]. Despite being a recommended mitigation strategy against frontrunning [9], it is not without limitations. In a recent study, Tumas et al. [10] demonstrated that the Canonical Order makes frontrunning attacks probabilistic, the frontrunner has a 50% chance of a successful attack. However, due to the low transaction fees, an attacker can perform frontrunning attacks with multiple accounts to increase their odds of success without incurring signi\ufb01cant additional costs, bypassing the bene\ufb01ts of the Canonical Order. The XRPLedger community released an Automated Mar- ket Maker (AMM) based DEX on the XRPLedger [11]. In contrast to CLOB, AMMs determine the exchange rate algorithmically. However, AMMs are also the most lucrative sources of frontrunning on the Ethereum network. Therefore, in this paper, we examine to what extent the existing frontrun- ning techniques of Ethereum apply to the XRPLedger AMM and whether the unique integration with the existing CLOB exposes new frontrunning opportunities. Concretely, our contributions are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Analyze the feasibility of frontrunning on the XRPLedger Automated Market Maker.\n\n\u2022 Demonstrate that the frontrunning techniques are feasible, and discover a new attack that takes advantage of the unique AMM/CLOB integration.\n\n\u2022 Provide heuristics for detecting these attacks.\n\nWe organize the remainder of this paper as follows. In Section II, we describe the relevant components of the XRPLedger and outline the AMM design. We describe the eval- uation methodology in Section III, examine the results in Section IV and discuss the results in Section V. Finally, we examine related work and conclude our work in Sections VI and VII.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nThis section provides necessary background information about XRPLedger, its decentralized exchange and frontrun- ning.\n\nA. XRPLedger\n\nThe XRPLedger is a public blockchain facilitating fast and cost-effective transfer of the digital native currency XRP. Each server follows the same deterministic rules to process user transactions and use XRPLedger Consensus Protocol [7] to agree on a blockchain state. 1) Accounts: An account corresponds to a holder of XRP and a source of transactions. Two \ufb01elds are relevant to our work: an Address and a Sequence number. The former uniquely identi\ufb01es the account, and the latter ensures that the same account transactions are executed in their submission order. 2) Transactions: A transaction is the only way to update the state of the XRPLedger. Each is identi\ufb01ed with a unique hash , sequence number and the address of the sending account. The sequence number ensures that transactions from the same account execute in their submission order. 3) Transaction Order: An in-depth review of the XRPLedger transaction execution order is outside the scope of this paper. We refer the reader to the work of Tumas et al. [10]. At a high level, servers execute transactions in the same order through a mechanism called Canonical Order . It is a set of rules that produce a deterministic, pseudo-randomly ordered list of transactions [8]. Transactions submitted by the same account are grouped by their submission order, but the overall order is pseudo-random. 4) Tokens: Any user can issue their own digital assets or tokens. A currency code and the address of the issuing account identify a token. Therefore, multiple tokens with the same currency code but a different issuing account may exist.\n\nB. Automated Market Maker\n\nThe XRPLedger DEX combines the AMM and CLOB, enabling traders to access liquidity on both based on the exchange rate. AMMs and CLOBs mainly differ in how they determine the token price. ACLOB is a list of buy and sell orders where the traders determine the exchange rate. The CLOB matches incoming trades with existing orders or places the orders on the list. In contrast, AMM pools the liquidity of two tokens and makes them available to traders at an algorithmically deter- mined price. 1) Traders: A trader is an entity that performs swaps against the AMMPool Instance. They exchange a token A for a token B or vice versa. Traders pay a fee for each swap they execute against the pool. 2) Liquidity Providers: Liquidity Providers (LPs) provide their assets to the pools for trading. In exchange, they receive LPTokens that they can use later to withdraw the liquidity provided plus collected fees.\n\n3) Conservation Function: AMMs use a mathematical formula called Conservation Function to balance the token amounts in the pool. Speci\ufb01cally, XRPLedger AMM uses a weighted geometric mean market maker (GM3):\n\nC = QW AA \u00d7 QW BB (1)\n\nWhere Q is the balance of tokens A and B in the pool, and W is the normalized weight of the token. No matter how the asset amounts in the pool change, C must remain constant. Therefore, when a trade removes some amount of asset A from the pool, they must put some amount of asset B to preserve C . 4) Spot-Price: The Spot-Price is the weighted ratio of the pool instance balances:\n\nSPA B =\n\nQB\n\nWB\n\nQA\n\nWA \u00d7 1\n\n1 \u2212 TFee (2)\n\nThe TFee is the trading fee for trades executed against the AMM instance. We can\u2019t rely on the spot price to determine the price of exchanging (or swapping) one asset in the pool for another. 5) Swap Out: ASwap Out function computes the minimum amount \u2206 B of token B we must put into the pool to receive \u2206 A amount of token A .\n\n\u2206 B = QB\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0 \u0012 QA\n\nQA \u2212 \u2206 A\n\n\u0013 WA\n\nWB \u2212 1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb 1\n\n1 \u2212 TFee (3)\n\n6) Swap In: Equation 4, calculates the maximum amount of \u2206 A one would receive for paying \u2206 B amount of token B :\n\n\u2206 A = QA \u00d7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0 1 \u2212 \u0012 QB\n\nQB + \u2206 B \u00d7 (1 \u2212 TFee )\n\n\u0013 WB\n\nWA \uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb (4)\n\n7) Slippage & Slippage Tolerance: Slippage is the differ- ence between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price. It may occur, for example, due to natural movements in the market. The trader can incorporate slippage tolerance into their trade to mitigate slippage. For example, using Equation 3, we computed that for \u2206 A = 1 TOK, we have to pay at least \u2206 B = 1 . 25 XRP. However, we are determined to receive our token. Therefore, we are willing to pay up to 10% more and thus, \ufb01nal \u2206 B = 1 . 25 + 1 . 25 \u2217 0 . 1 = 1 . 375 XRP. Low slippage tolerance may result in the trade failing due to natural market movement. However, a high slippage tolerance exposes the trader to frontrunning .\n\nC. Frontrunning on XRPLedger\n\n1) Types: Broadly, there are two categories of frontrunning attacks [12]: destructive and tolerant . a) Destructive: A destructive frontrunner infers that a victim\u2019s transaction is pro\ufb01table, copies it, and submits it before the victim. If the frontrunner transaction executes \ufb01rst, the victim\u2019s transaction will fail.\n\nb) Tolerant: A tolerant frontrunner exploits the price margin between the victim\u2019s trader and the optimal cost of the token. The attacker purchases the token before the victim at an optimal price and sells it back at an increased price. We only consider tolerant frontrunning. 2) Sources: We differentiate between two sources of fron- trunning attacks: miners or, in the case of XRPLedger validators and users . a) Validator Frontrunning: XRPLedger eliminates sin- gle validator frontrunning. Each validator declares a unique node list (UNL) of other validators it trusts. During the consensus process, the validator only considers the votes of the servers within their UNL. A ledger is accepted when at least 80% of UNL validators agree on its content. No single decision-maker can propose an alternate transaction order that enables frontrunning. Validators may frontrun as a group. While theoretically possible, at least 80% trusted validators would have to behave maliciously. However, this is highly unlikely as most validators use the same UNL[13]. The XRPLedger Foundation veri\ufb01es validator identities before including them in the trusted UNL. Therefore, the validators are under social pressure to behave correctly. b) User Frontrunning: On XRPLedger, the frontrunner has a 50% success chance. When the frontrunners\u2019 transactions execute before the victim, they win. Otherwise, they lose. However, the advantages of the low transaction fees also bring drawbacks. The frontrunners can employ multiple accounts to attack a victim, allowing them to increase their odds of success without incurring signi\ufb01cant additional costs [10].\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n\nThis section describes the frontrunning attacks feasible on the XRPLedger AMM.\n\nA. Preliminaries\n\n1) Detecting Opportunities: The frontrunner requires a stream of pending transactions, existing offers on the CLOB and the state of AMMLiquidity Pools. The frontrunner can get this information via a set of convenient WebSocket APIs [14]. 2) Frontrunner Model: A frontrunner is an entity listening for incoming pending transactions to launch a frontrunning attack once it detects a pro\ufb01table opportunity. We assume, the frontrunner is using A = { a 1 , ..., a n } accounts to perform the attacks, where n > 1 . 3) Fees: There are four costs associated with a frontrunning attack. a) Transaction Fee.: A non-recoverable XRP amount that is burnt to process the transaction. It is the only source of loss for the attacker. b) Reserve.: A recoverable XRP amount that is locked as a mechanism to control the blockchain growth [14]. c) Liquidity.: Liquidity represents the funds needed to perform an attack. It forms a signi\ufb01cant portion of the at- tacker\u2019s capital.\n\nd) AMMFees.: The AMM charges each trade a small fee. These fees are accumulated in the pool and can be withdrawn by the Liquidity Providers.\n\nB. Frontrunning Opportunities\n\nInsertion or sandwich attack is the most frequent type of frontrunning on Ethereum [3], [6]. In an insertion attack, a frontrunner F observes a pro\ufb01table transaction from the victim TV from a victim V and submits two transactions TF 1 and TF 2 to the network. The attacker sends the transactions so that TF 1 executes before TV and TF 2 after it. However, some insertion attacks require that TF 1 and TF 2 execute before TV . Due to this difference, we will use the term Sandwich attack to identify frontrunning attacks that surround the victim, and Insertion attack to identify ones that do not.\n\nC. Terminology\n\nFor the reader\u2019s convenience, we provide a list of terminol- ogy.\n\n\u2022 V and F refer to the victim and the frontrunner, respec- tively.\n\n\u2022 P ( Q x , Q y ) refers to a AMMPool Instance for the token pair ( x, y ) , where Q is the amount of each token in the pool.\n\n\u2022 O (\u2206 x , \u2206 y ) is a CLOB offer selling \u2206 x for \u2206 y tokens.\n\n\u2022 T ( p, s, r, o, i ) is a DEX transaction. p is the transactions position in the ledger, s and r are the sender and receiver account addresses, and o and i are the token amounts s is buying and is willing to pay.\n\n\u2022 swap out ( P ( Q x , Q y ) , T \u2206 x ) = \u2206 y \u2212 min is the minimum cost of swapping out T \u2206 x tokens given the Pool Instance P ( Q x , Q y ) .\n\n\u2022 spot price ( P ( Q x , Q y )) is the Spot-Price of the AMMPool Instance P ( Q x , Q y ) .\n\n\u2022 exchange rate ( O ( Q x , Q y )) is the exchange rate of offer O ( Q x , Q y ) , it is the ratio of offer token amounts.\n\nD. AMMSandwich\n\nAssume an AMMPool Instance containing 5 TOK and 5 XRP. In this pool, the minimum cost of swapping out 2 TOK is \u2248 3.34 XRP. A trader places a trade attempting to buy 2 TOK for up to 4 XRP (See Figure 1a), allowing the frontrunner to capitalize on some of the slippage tolerance. The frontrunner purchases just enough TOK from the AMMPool Instance so as not to cause the victim\u2019s transaction to fail. Then, he sells the TOK after the victim\u2019s transaction is processed, capitalizing on the increased asset price. Assume an AMMP ( Q x , Q y ) and the victim\u2019s transaction TV . The transaction is worth frontrunning when TV ( i ) \u2212 swap out ( P ( Q x , Q y ) , TV ( o )) > bn , where b is the base transaction fee and n is the number of accounts the frontrunner is using for the attack. In other words, when the difference between the amount the victim is paying and the optimal price is larger than the cost of the frontrunning attack with n accounts.\n\nT v\n\nTF-buy\n\nTF-sell\n\nToken x quantity\n\nToken y quantity\n\n(a) Sandwich attack effect on the AMM pools\n\nT attacker-buy\n\nT attacker-buy\n\nT victim-buy\n\nT attacker-buy\n\nT u\n\nT attacker-sell\n\nT 2\n\nT 3\n\nT 4\n\nT u\n\n(b) Frontrunner transactions\n\nFig. 1: AMMSandwich Attack\n\n1) Detecting AMMSandwich: With one transaction, the cross-currency payment feature [15] allows the frontrunner to purchase tokens from the pool and send them to the selling account. Let TF 1 = {\u2200 ( TF a , TF b ) \u2208T : T a ( p, s ) \u0338 = T b ( p, s ) \u2227 T a ( r, o, i ) = T b ( r, o, i ) } , |TF 1 | = n \u2212 1 . It is a set of frontrunner\u2019s purchase transactions submitted with n \u2212 1 accounts, where each transaction buys an identical amount of tokens for the same price and sends the purchased tokens to the seller account r . Let TF 2 denote the frontrunner\u2019s sell transaction, where \u2200 TF \u2208T : TF ( r ) = TF 2 ( s ) . Let TV denote the victim\u2019s transaction. We detect sandwich attacks by examining any two adjacent ledgers ( L n , L n +1 ) , and examining whether TF 1 , TV and TF 2 transactions exist for which the following rules hold:\n\n\u2022 Rule 1: Transactions TF 1 , TV and TF 2 must operate with the same token pair ( x, y ) .\n\n\u2022 Rule 2: The receiver TF 1 ( r ) is equal to the sender TF 2 ( s ) .\n\n\u2022 Rule 3: The transaction set is TF 1 \u2208 L n and the sell transaction TF 2 \u2208 L n +1 . The attack is successful only when it spans at least two blocks, as illustrated in Figure 1b. The sell transaction must occur in a separate ledger to ensure it is executed after the victim. Otherwise, if TF 2 \u2208 L n , the Canonical Order may order TF 2 before TV , causing the frontrunning attack to fail.\n\n\u2022 Rule 4: The token amount bought by TF 1 is approximate to the number of tokens sold by TF 2 . It should be set with a tolerance threshold to avoid false positives.\n\n\u2022 Rule 5: \u2203 TF \u2208TF 1 : TF ( p ) < TV ( p ) . At least one attacker\u2019s transaction executes before the victim. As long as at least one TF 1 executes successfully, all other TF 1( n \u2212 2) will fail.\n\n\u2022 Rule 6: Let TF 1 \u2212 win denote the frontunners account positioned before the victim. The victim receives TV ( o ) from the AMM and sends TV ( i ) tokens to the AMM. In addition, TF 1 \u2212 win ( s ) sends TF 1 \u2212 win ( i ) tokens to TF 2 ( s ) at the cost of TF 1 \u2212 win ( o ) tokens. Finally, TF 2 ( i ) > TF 1 \u2212 win ( o ) . Note that the heuristic detects an attempted but failed attack if Rules 1 - 4 hold and Rules 5 & 6 do not.\n\nE. AMM/CLOBInsertion\n\nThe AMM and CLOB interaction introduces a new attack. Assume an AMM containing 5 TOK and 5 XRP and a CLOB sell offer of 10 XRP for 2 TOK. The AMM spot price is 1 . 0 , whereas the CLOB quality is 0 . 2 (Figure 2a). A trader places an offer to buy 2 TOK for 4 XRP. Without the frontrunner, the purchase would execute against the AMM as it offers a better price. However, the frontrunner can capitalize on the entire victims slippage tolerance by forcing them to purchase from the CLOB. The frontrunner purchases the 2 TOK the victim is attempting to buy at an optimal price. The AMM spot price will be driven down when the purchase is executed. Secondly, the frontrunner creates a sell offer on the CLOB, selling the 2 TOK for 4 XRP, increasing the CLOB quality above the AMM (see Figure 2c). In case the frontrunner transactions execute before the victim, the victim buy offer will execute against the CLOB, as it provides a better exchange rate. Assume victim transaction TV , an AMMP ( Q x , Q y ) and a CLOB sell offer O (\u2206 x , \u2206 y ) , and the spot price ( P ( Q x , Q y )) > exchange rate ( O (\u2206 x , \u2206 y )) (See Figure 2a). Victim is worth frontrunning when the exchange rate ( OF (\u2206 x , \u2206 y )) > spot price ( P \u2032 ( Q x , Q y )) . Where, OF (\u2206 x , \u2206 y ) is the frontrunner\u2019s offer on the CLOB such that OF (\u2206 x ) = TV ( o ) and OF (\u2206 y ) = TV ( i ) . The P \u2032 ( Q x , Q y ) is the posterior AMM state after executing TF such that TF ( o ) = TV ( o ) and TF ( i ) = swap out ( P ( Q x , Q y ) , TV ( o )) . 1) Detecting AMM/CLOBInsertion: TCLOB is a transac- tion that crosses the CLOB. The attacker creates a set of transactions TF such that |TF | = n . Each set entry is TF \u2212 buy purchasing tokens from the AMM, and TF \u2212 CLOB creating the CLOB offer. TF \u2212 buy refers to all purchase transactions and TF \u2212 CLOB ) refers to all CLOB transactions. We detect a hybrid attack by searching for transactions that hold the following heuristics:\n\n\u2022 Rule 1: Transactions TF , TV must operate with same token pair ( x, y ) .\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Spot Price (Token / XRP)\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\nToken Amount\n\nSP\n\nLOBQuality\n\n(a) Initial LOB & AMM states\n\nT attacker-buy\n\nT attacker-sell\n\nT victim-buy\n\nT attacker-buy\n\nT u\n\n(b) Frontrunner transactions\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Spot Price (Token / XRP)\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\nToken Amount\n\nSP'\n\nNew LOBQuality\n\n(c) Modi\ufb01ed AMM & LOB states\n\nFig. 2: AMM/LOB attack breakdown\n\n\u2022 Rule 2: There must be at least one frontrunner transaction pair before the victim. \u2203 ( TF \u2212 buy , TF \u2212 CLOB ) \u2208TF : TF \u2212 buy ( p ) < TF \u2212 CLOB ( p ) < TV ( p ) (See Figure 2b).\n\n\u2022 Rule 3: The token amount bought by TF ( TF \u2212 buy ) is similar to the number of tokens sold by TF ( TF \u2212 CLOB ) .\n\n\u2022 Rule 4: Transaction TV executes against the CLOB, and consumes OF (\u2206 x , \u2206 y ) , where OF (\u2206 x ) = TF \u2212 CLOB ( o ) and OF (\u2206 y ) = TF \u2212 CLOB ( i ) .\n\nIV. EVALUATION In this section, we describe the evaluation methodology and discuss the results. Frontrunning is an unethical activ- ity. Therefore, we conducted the experiments on the AMM- Devnet parallel network speci\ufb01cally created to test the AMM functionality. In addition, we do not publically disclose our frontrunning system, as doing so would pave an easy path for frontrunners to the XRPLedger.\n\nA. Methodology 1) Goals: We designed the evaluation with two goals in mind:\n\n\u2022 Determine if the attacks are possible on the AMM.\n\n\u2022 Quantify the probability of success of these attacks. 2) Setup: Brie\ufb02y, the system works as follows: a) Initial State: The bot creates a zero-fee AMMPool for 5 TOK and 5 XRP. Increasing the fee would reduce the frontrunner\u2019s pro\ufb01ts but would not affect the probability of success. For both attack types, the bot issues a victim transaction attempting to purchase 2 TOK for 4 XRP. In the case of the AMM/CLOBInsertion attack, the bot creates a CLOB offer selling 2 TOK for 10 XRP. b) Attacker Transactions: The bot computes the fron- trunner transactions based on the speci\ufb01c attack type. The bot calculates the maximum token amount to purchase for AMMSandwich without failing the victim\u2019s transaction. In the case of the AMM/CLOBInsertion, the bot clones the victim\u2019s transaction and creates a sell offer that is guaranteed to appear on the CLOB. c) Frontrunning: The bot submits batched attacker and victim transactions and determines the attack\u2019s success by whether the attacker\u2019s account balances increased. The batch- ing ensures that transactions occur in the same ledger.\n\n3) Statistical Signi\ufb01cance: Frontrunning on XRPLedger is probabilistic. Therefore, the bot conducted 1,000 experiments for each frontrunning type. Each iteration lasts approximately 43.2 seconds as the bot prepares fresh AMM and CLOB states before each iteration. As discussed in Section II, the Canonical Order combines the transaction account address with a random seed using an XOR operation. Therefore, to add more variance to the ledger data at each iteration, the simulator picked three frontrunner accounts and one victim account from a pool of 1,000 pre- funded accounts.\n\nTotal Successes Failures Rate\n\nSandwich 1,000 837 163 0.837\n\nAMM/CLOB 1,000 794 206 0.794\n\nTABLEI: The frontrunning results on the AMM-Devnet.\n\n4) Results: Table I shows the results of the frontrunning bot. Note that the AMM-Devnet has a low transaction volume. Therefore, our transactions dominated the ledgers, potentially skewing the probabilities. Despite this, the results show that the AMMSandwich attack is feasible on the XRPLedger AMM, and the CLOB integration creates an opportunity for a new type of frontrunning attack.\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nOn XRPLedger, an attacker with a single account has a 50% probability of a successful attack. However, they can use multiple accounts to increase their odds. Our results show that this principle also applies to the AMM.\n\nA. Low delay\n\nThe XRPLedger processes a new ledger every \u2248 4 seconds, having a two-fold effect on frontrunning. First, the attacker has little time to observe, compute and issue their transaction. Second, fast con\ufb01rmation may increase the slippage users experience. On Ethereum, the AMM price change between two blocks is minimal [16]. However, the duration between two blocks is around 12 seconds, giving arbitrageurs more time to insert transactions that re-balance the AMM, and the arbitrageurs can affect where in the block their transaction executes. In contrast, XRPLedger produces 3 to 4 ledgers\n\nin the same period. Each produced ledger may cause further AMM price \ufb02uctuation. Furthermore, arbitrageurs cannot in- \ufb02uence transaction execution order. Thus, they must submit the re-balancing transactions in a subsequent ledger. In summary, fast transaction con\ufb01rmation may cause a higher price \ufb02uctuation, resulting in traders incorporating higher slippage tolerance to account for the \ufb02uctuation, pro- viding lucrative frontrunning opportunities.\n\nB. Pro\ufb01tability\n\nThe average transaction cost on Ethereum is \u2248 6 . 83$ . These fees go to the miners as part of the incentive system. The revenue of Sandwich attacks on Ethereum was 126 M $ in 2022 [6]. However, the frontrunners paid 101 M $ or nearly 79% for the transaction. In contrast, XRPLedger transaction costs are low, around 0.00001XRP, or \u2248 0 . 000006 USD, and the fees are burnt. There is no incentive system. Thus, we summarize that when the popularity of XRPLedger AMM reaches that of Ethereum AMMs, XRPLedger frontrunning will be more pro\ufb01table.\n\nC. Mitigation\n\nThe content of transactions is public, and the consensus introduces a delay between the transaction submission and \ufb01- nalization. Therefore, adversaries can act based on the content of the yet-to-be-executed transactions. In addition, transactions are processed in a pseudo-random order, making frontrunning probabilistic. Nonetheless, due to the low transaction cost, frontrunners can use multiple accounts to increase their odds of success. Removing one of these properties would prevent or make frontrunning signi\ufb01cantly more dif\ufb01cult. 1) Hiding Transaction Content: Cryptographic primitives, such as Threshold Encryption, can hide transaction content. The user encrypts their transaction using a global public key. A group of decryptors holds shares of the corresponding private key. Once the consensus \ufb01nalizes a ledger of encrypted trans- actions, the decryptors collectively decrypt the transactions. Threshold encryption is a natural \ufb01t for the XRPLedger as the validators can act as decryptors. However, threshold encryption increases the time between the submission and \ufb01- nalization of the transaction. Intuitively, the delay comes from an additional communication round between the decryptors to decrypt the transaction. 2) Fair Transaction Order: The second strategy prevents frontrunning by ordering ledger transactions in a fair order. Order is fair when no one can include or exclude transactions from a ledger after seeing their content and insert transactions before transactions whose contents were observed [17]. Committee-based approaches are well studied [18], [19], [20]. They rely on a committee of nodes observing incoming transactions and agreeing on a fair order through a consensus. For example, given two transactions tx and tx\u2019 , the receive order fairness ensures that tx will be \ufb01nalized before tx\u2019 if a majority of consensus nodes received tx before tx\u2019 . A committee-based approach is a natural \ufb01t for the XRPLedger due to its consensus protocol. However, the consensus\n\nwould have to agree on another property: transaction execution order, again slowing down the blockchain. Both strategies would require modifying the existing battle- tested system. Therefore, the bene\ufb01ts of such an approach must signi\ufb01cantly outweigh the risks.\n\nVI. RELATED WORK\n\nFrontrunning is a well-known issue on Ethereum. Eskan- dari et al. [21] created the \ufb01rst frontrunning attack taxonomy. Daian et al. [4] gave evidence of frontrunning from monitoring Ethereum\u2019s mempool. Torres et al. [3] provided the \ufb01rst lower bound on the frontrunner pro\ufb01ts in Ethereum\u2019s transaction history and provided heuristics to detect these attacks. We expand on their work by extending the heuristics for XRPLedger. Tumas et al. [10] are the \ufb01rst to analyse frontrunning on XRPLedger. They provide two strategies an attacker may use to increase the probability of success and show the existence of frontrunning. We expand on their work by conducting frontrunning analysis on the XRPLedger AMM. Several works propose frontrunning mitigation strategies based on varying techniques. Most recently, Constantinescu et al. [22] proposed a Layer-2 protocol in which a group of syn- chronised clock nodes run a consensus protocol that provides each transaction with a receive timestamp. The Layer-1 con- sensus protocol can use the timestamps to order transactions. Misra et al. [23] provide a causal-ordering preserving protocol in a synchronous blockchain. Although these works effec- tively address the frontrunning problem, they make synchrony assumptions that may not be feasible in existing blockchain systems. Fair transaction order is a prevalent topic [18], [20], [19]. However, these techniques are designed for private blockchains and may not work on a public blockchain like XRPLedger. Other solutions prevent frontrunning with advanced commit-and-reveal scheme [24], tighter slippage protection [16], or new more frontrunning-resistant decentralised ex- changes [25], [26], [27], [28]. These solutions slow down the blockchain, introduce higher fees or do not necessarily protect against every type of frontrunning attack.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK\n\nIn this paper, we analyse frontrunning on the XRPLedger AMM. We show that some frontrunning techniques applicable to Ethereum also apply to XRPLedger AMM. Furthermore, we discovered a new AMM/CLOBInsertion attack that lever- ages interaction between AMM and the CLOB. Finally, we validate these attacks on the XRPLedger AMM-Devnet . The XRPLedger AMM recently launched. However, more data is needed to examine whether frontrunning is taking place. Continuing this work will analyse frontrunning attacks on the XRPLedger mainnet and, more importantly, investigate how to prevent these attacks. Typical mitigation strategies proposed for other blockchains, such as Ethereum, do not work on XRPLedger as the blockchain does not support smart contracts. Therefore, novel solutions are required.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] C. A.
