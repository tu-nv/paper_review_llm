        "abstract": "Most cryptocurrencies are bought and sold on centralized exchanges that manage supply and demand via an order book. Besides trading fees, the high liquidity of a market is the most relevant reason for choosing one exchange over the other. However, as the different liquidity measures rely on the order book, external events that cause people to sell or buy a cryptocurrency can significantly impact a market's liquidity. To investigate the effect of external events on liquidity, we measure various liquidity measures for nine different order books comprising three currency pairs across three exchanges covering the entire year 2022. The resulting multivariate time series is then analyzed using different correlations.\nFrom the results, we can infer that as a cryptocurrency's market capitalization and the exchange's trading volume increases, so does its liquidity. At the same time, only a moderate correlation of liquidity between exchanges can be observed. Furthermore, our statistical observations show that external events, particularly the events around FTX and the Terra Luna crash, caused significant changes in liquidity. However, depending on the exchange's size and the cryptocurrency's market cap, the liquidity took a shorter or longer time to recover.",

In our proposed solution, blockchain provides a solution by establishing transparency in every node of the product's lifecycle when users can exchange/sell/buy NFTs. In brief, it is a decentralised list of records or data, known as a block, connected using encryption technology which works in our developed blockchain platform.

        "abstract": "Decentralized exchanges often need to combine liquidity from multiple sources in order to provide the best prices to their users. However, combining liquidity from multiple sources into a single trade has not only required high transaction fees, but is also computationally expensive. Here, we propose a framework for combining liquidity from multiple sources, called Aggregate Liquidity Technology (ALT). ALT maps each liquidity source onto a 2-dimensional space as a curve or line segment, where the input token is on one axis and the output token is on the other. Once this is accomplished, liquidity sources can be combined by finding the points where the curves or lines intersect. Users can get the optimal liquidity on each trade by maximizing the number of output tokens returned. ALT is implemented into Polkaswap on the Parity Substrate-based SORA network, which has processed more than $1 billion worth of token swaps. While the current iteration of ALT works only on a single blockchain network, future work should explore ways to combine liquidity using this methodology across multiple blockchain networks and even centralized exchanges.",

The latter might help to improve the exchange price by distributing the order volume between XYK pools and the token bonding curves buy function. Additionally, the article describes the scenario of using XOR Synthetics (XST) to increase available liquidity, and therefore again improve the final price.",

Verification of the integrity of the data stored in this ledger can be done without the need for a TTP.

Smart contracts are another key element of the blockchain as they allow the creation of decentralized automated applications based on pre-established rules. They are also used to create unique digital assets (such as artwork, real estate, collectibles, etc.) by representing them as NFTs. These NFTs can then be sold and purchased transparently and securely on the blockchain.

The growth of cutting-edge technologies makes many options open to adopting a secure architecture for fintech organizations.

The study proposes a comprehensive architecture based on consortium blockchain, hyperledger fabric in a hybrid cloud environment. The proposed architecture is a theoretical approach. Nevertheless, consortium blockchain and hybrid cloud performance to secure any application are already proved individually in different fields.

        "abstract": "With the advent of NFT which proves the ownership of assets, security tokens that enable transactions without intermediaries are becoming a hot topic. By tokenization, there is no need for centralized markets, and it enables fast trades. In addition to tokenization, there are also attempts to increase the liquidity of assets by fractionalizing them. This is called fractional ownership. Even though there are already some platforms in service that use tokenization and fractional ownership, not much research has been done on fractional NFT. Fractional NFT is also still lacking institutionally. For this reason, we analyze fractional NFT in this paper. Since most of the NFTs in the world are minted based on the Ethereum blockchain, we implement fractional NFTs based on ERC standards. We also evaluate the gas cost of the implementation because gas cost plays an important role in providing fractional NFT-related services. Our evaluation results show that the gas cost is the lowest when NFTs of ERC-721 or ERC-1155 are fractionalized into FTs of ERC-20 in the long-term view.",

We accordingly implement and propose the scheme under Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) standards, indexed in EIP-XX. Further, we provide the mathematical formation to analyze the utility for each rNFT participant. The discussion gives general guidance among multi-dimensional parameters. The solution, as a result, shape the recognition of potential values hidden in isolated NFTs and raise the interest of communities toward the discovery of NFT derivatives.

        "abstract": "Trading for a currency pair on centralized crypto exchanges is organized via an order book, which collects all open buy and sell orders at any given time and thus forms the basis for price formation. Usually, the exchanges provide basic visualizations, which show the accumulated buy and sell volume in an animated 2D representation. However, this visualization does not allow the user to compare different order books, e.g., several order book snapshots. In this work, we present OrderBookVis, a 2.5D representation that shows a discrete set of order books comparatively. For this purpose, the individual snapshots are displayed as a 2D representation as usual and placed one after the other on a 2D reference plane. As possible use cases, we discuss the analysis of the temporal evolution of the order book for a fixed market and the comparison of different order books across multiple markets.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents DEEPER, a design for a decentralized exchange that enhances the average active liquidity via reserve sharing. By doing this, it addresses the problem of shallow liquidity in low trading volume token pairs. DEEPER allows liquidity providers of multiple trading pairs against a common token to share liquidity. This is achieved by creating a common reserve pool for the shared token that is accessible by each trading pair. Independent from the shared liquidity, providers are free to add liquidity to individual token pairs without any restriction. The trading between one token pair does not affect the price of other token pairs even though the reserve of the shared token changes. The proposed design is an extension of concentrated liquidity market maker-based DEXs that is simple enough to be implemented on smart contracts. Experiments show that for a batch consisting of 8 trading pairs, DEEPER enhances liquidity by over 2.6 \u2212 5.9\u00d7.

        "abstract": "Algorithmic stablecoins (AS) are one special type of stablecoins that are not backed by any asset. They stand to revolutionize the way a sovereign fiat operates. As implemented, these coins are poorly stabilized in most cases, easily deviating from the price target or even falling into a catastrophic collapse, and are as a result dismissed as a Ponzi scheme. However, is this the whole picture? In this paper, we try to reveal the truth and clarify such a deceptive concept. We find that Ponzi is basically a financial protocol that pays existing investors with funds collected from new ones. Running a Ponzi, however, does not necessarily imply that any participant is in any sense losing out, as long as the game can be perpetually rolled over. Economists call such realization as a rational Ponzi game. We thereby propose a rational model in the context of AS and draw its holding conditions. We apply the model to examine: whether or not the algorithmic stablecoin is a rational Ponzi game. Accordingly, we discuss two types of algorithmic stablecoins (Rebase & Seigniorage shares) and dig into the historical market performance of a number of impactful projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",
