        "title": "Detection of NFT Duplications with Image Hash Functions",
        "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets representing ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item. NFTs are blockchain-based and rely on smart contracts. The increase in duplicate NFTs in recent years brings the need for discovery tools for forged NFTs, some of which include using image hash functions. Though the problem of image duplication is widely discussed, detecting NFT duplications requires using fast detection methods as a new NFT image needs to be compared with the entire NFT history on the blockchain. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several image-hash functions, examine the cases where each function performs well, and evaluate multiple image-hash-functions-based NFT duplication detectors. Our models achieve more than 97.5% success in detecting NFT duplications and show that using several hash functions rather than one increases the ability to detect duplications.",

The use of image hashing functions for fast NFT duplication detection is a novel application that deals with the practical limitations of blockchain-based systems.\nThe quality of the research is high, as it involves a comprehensive analysis of six image hash functions and examines their effectiveness in identifying various types of image modifications. The empirical evaluation is methodologically sound, based on an explicitly created dataset grounded in OpenSea's definitions of copying.\nThe paper is well-written with clear organization. The exposition of image hashing techniques and the evaluative criteria based on OpenSea's policies provide a transparent framework for the novel detector models developed thereafter.\nThe significance of this work lies in its practical implications. As the paper outlines, ensuring the uniqueness of NFTs is critical to their value and the broader market. The proposed detection models can contribute to buyer reassurance in NFT marketplaces and potentially reduce legal issues related to copyright infringement.",

        "abstract": "In decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the arbitrage paths exist abundantly in the form of both arbitrage loops (e.g. the arbitrage path starts from token A and back to token A again in the end, A->B->,..., A) and non-loops (e.g. the arbitrage path starts from token A and stops at a different token N, A->B->,...->N).  The Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm, often coupled with the \"walk to the root\" technique, is commonly employed for detecting arbitrage loops in the token graph of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap.\nHowever, a limitation of this algorithm is its ability to recognize only a limited number of arbitrage loops in each run. Additionally, it cannot specify the starting token of the detected arbitrage loops, further constraining its effectiveness in certain scenarios.\nAnother limitation of this algorithm is its incapacity to detect non-loop arbitrage paths between any specified pairs of tokens.\nIn this paper, we develop a new method to solve these problems by combining the line graph and a modified Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm (MMBF). This method can find more arbitrage loops by detecting at least one arbitrage loop starting from any specified tokens in the DEXs and can detect the non-loop arbitrage paths between any pair of tokens.\nThen, we applied our algorithm to Uniswap V2 and found more arbitrage loops and non-loops indeed compared with applying the Moore-Bellman-Ford (MBF) combined algorithm. The found arbitrage profit by our method in some arbitrage paths can be even as high as one million dollars, far larger than that found by the MBF combined algorithm.\nFinally, we statistically compare the distribution of arbitrage path lengths and the arbitrage profit detected by both our method and the MBF combined algorithm, and depict how potential arbitrage opportunities change with time by our method.",

The clarity of the paper is commendable, with well-structured sections and a clear description of the proposed method, which is detailed enough for replication. Finally, the significance of this study is evident as it provides useful tools for DEX market participants and could potentially improve market efficiency by facilitating the detection of more arbitrage opportunities.",

The proposed algorithm is far superior in terms of its success in finding negative price cycles of token pairs and, hence, the net dollar opportunity of arbitrage. 3) The proposed algorithm shows how a slight modification of the MBF algorithm can result in orders of magnitude improvements, proving it to be a novel solution.",

By systematically applying the algorithm to each token as a source, potential loops and non-loops are enumerated along with their maximum profits. Historical data from Uniswap V2 is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, revealing significant arbitrage opportunities over time, though their total value decreased, prompting further research.\nThe proposed method is both logically sound and empirically demonstrated to be superior in effectiveness"

Given the politico-legal framework under which the central banks exist and operate, there exists a room for policy-making that affects financial worth of an individual and in turn of a nation -- thus highlighting the role of transparency in the discretionary powers of a central bank. In the recent past, the technological innovations from information technology have helped central banks to introduce digital currency; thus, cutting costs in management of currency and bringing speed in its movement. This technological evolution also brought in privacy concerns while checking the double-spend problem. Blockchain based cryptocurrency has addressed the double-spend problem in digital currency but introduced itself as a global open currency where role of central bank is done by an algorithm.\n\nIn the long and eventful evolution of currency we have come to a stage where one needs to reconsider the key decisions from the past that influenced the evolution of currency.

Perpetual swaps provide a new strategic risk management tool for cryptocurrencies due to their custody-free nature, high leverage, and funding mechanism, but there has been little quantitative analysis on the their benefits. In this paper, we introduce a trading strategy that combines a Quanto Perpetual Swap with a spot position to benefit from the funding mechanism. We compare our strategy with a long-only investment in the underlying cryptocurrency and a similar strategy based on Linear Perpetual Swaps to evaluate their performances in a large-scale backtest covering the years 2021 and 2022.

This is why the strategies involving linear perpetual swaps, as described in the article, result in losses. On the other hand, strategies incorporating quantum perpetual swaps show profitability. It seems plausible, however, that this profitability is not derived from funding rates but rather from the fact that the profit and loss (P&L) of these derivatives are denominated not in the base asset (i.e., USD) but in Bitcoin. Consequently, if Bitcoin's value surged, the portfolio, which was not delta-neutral relative to Bitcoin, would significantly increase in value, and vice versa.",

However, the critical evaluation is how valuable the predicted information is at specific points for a real trading strategy. \n\nSecondly, the core of the model's approach evaluates the smoothed return over the last three days. Given the high correlation among crypto assets relative to a base asset like the USD, any prolonged bullish market trend tends to penalize portfolios containing crypto assets excessively. This is evident in the authors' results, showing the model almost completely shifted the portfolio to USD at the beginning of 2021 and remained there, ignoring the substantial market growth until June of the same year. Therefore, longer prediction periods might be necessary for this type of investment, though the accuracy of predictions is likely to decrease with the extension of the prediction period.

However, starting from the abstract, the authors lack the ability to explain what is the novelty or additional value of this paper. It tries to explain basic concepts like ERC standards, NFT marketplaces, Dexes on 2 pages, but also the Methodology section is only a continuation of the theory of the paper. Therefore, if we count also Methodology, the paper has nearly 6 pages of theory without saying any contribution (except the \"Our proposed Royalty Distribution Mechanism\" paragraph on 12 lines on page 6). But even the small paragraph only says that the authors have done engineering work in changing some attributes of the original smart contract, which utilizes ERC2981 standard. \nThe signal of not being able to present this paper in an easier approach based on motivation - key novelty - problem - solution proposal - evaluation - discussion is Related work sections, which is totally off-topic to the paper (it reads as if it was a bachelor thesis, where student analyzed everything with a word by word approach). It describes papers about crypto investments, Uniswap AMM, liquidity pools, market microstructure, NFTs...The authors need to start with related work at first in this place to support further a problem (which needs to be accepted by the community as a problem), and after, they can try to convince the reader that their proposal makes sense.\nEven the Future work section is somewhat irrelevant and comes as a bolt from the blue, where even the analysis about flash loans continuous. The majority of the paper is built around NFTs and NFT marketplaces, how is this relevant? The NFT flash loans were introduced in EIP6682, but this is not mentioned, so I'm not getting why flash loans are even mentioned here.\nThe majority of references are websites, and even those badly cited without a \"visited on:...\" part. The references need to be adjusted according to the main contribution of the paper, which is, to me, unknown.\nThe paper needs to be strengthened by empirical validation of the proposed methods and concepts, such as testing the effectiveness and the practicalities of the new royalty distribution mechanism (if that wants to be the novelty).

        "abstract": "Cryptocurrency arbitrage, a riskless trading strategy, can yield profits but requires swift execution due to volatile opportunities that vanish rapidly. Utilizing arbitrage bots for algorithmic trading is essential for immediate trade execution across exchanges like Binance and Bybit. This study implements such a system focusing on BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT pairs. Integrating Machine Learning (ML) aims to predict arbitrage occurrences in advance for faster trade execution, a tactic overlooked by many traders. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron models are implemented. The addition of Machine Learning principles required the collection of a dataset with historical prices of the observed cryptocurrency pairs for various time intervals, on which we trained the model. Afterward, the model was evaluated in a live-trading environment. Results show Random Forest predicting exploitable arbitrage intervals ahead for Ether, with ML models more effective during less volatile periods. However, careful consideration is needed as predictions may not always align with market realities, leading to mixed trading outcomes. Furthermore, the training led to a model that is able to predict the occurrence of arbitrage, however, classifying the calculations even more carefully than in reality, resulting in a partially profitable or partially lossy trading strategy depending on the time of day and the current stage of the market.",

The specific period chosen for training and prediction needs further explanation. The current example relies on a relatively short interval without considering specific edge cases. The paper lacks discussion on \u2018data snooping bias\u2019 and a clear selection methodology for test/train and persistence. Those might raise doubts about the validity of the results.\n\n2. When dealing with substantial amounts, such as hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, relying solely on bid and ask prices to determine transaction costs is inadequate. This approach fails to account for market depth, meaning that the liquidity available at the prices quoted by exchange APIs may represent only a fraction of the market. As a result, the actual execution price for significant orders, such as selling or buying assets worth a million dollars, can deviate markedly from the quoted prices. This discrepancy could dramatically alter the perceived profitability of arbitrage opportunities. \n\n3. The authors should address the practical constraints of arbitrage trading between two exchanges, such as the inability to instantaneously transfer funds from one platform to another and the potential fees associated with depositing and withdrawing funds. These factors can naturally cause price differences between exchanges, but they do not necessarily indicate a viable arbitrage opportunity."

                "The authors aim to apply machine learning techniques to predict arbitrage occurrences for BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT pairs on centralized exchanges in advance for faster trade execution and profitability. The authors perform extensive parameter search on four different types of ML models, and different prediction time interval. The results show that Random Forest is able to predict exploitable arbitrage minutes ahead in less volatile pairs, specifically ETH-USDT, with high accuracy and recall. The authors also observe a reduction in ML model performance when applied to highly volatile pairs, where arbitrage can happen more frequently.\nIn Section I and II, basic concepts of centralized exchanges, arbitrage and types of ML models are introduced, providing background material for this paper. The potential application of ML in exploiting more arbitrage opportunities is hypothesized. However, there are several definitions missing. 1) Efficiency of market and why it is important: if market is efficient, prices at any time perfectly reflect all available information, and there should be no arbitrage opportunities; 2) volatility of crypto currency is not defined (historical or implied?); 3) Need proper reference and justification for the argument in II.A: the prices of Bitcoin in terms of USDT reflects the current global economic situation.\nIn Section III, several prior works on ML in predicting arbitrage opportunities are discussed. The authors argue that there is a lack of validation and little focus of machine learning prediction in these works, justifying the potential value of this paper.\nIn Section IV, the authors discuss bid-ask spread and transaction fees, but in the actual dataset construction and prediction, only OHLCV (open, high, low, close and traded volumes) are used. It would be beneficial to incorporate bid-ask price and spread in prediction. Or if these features are used, more details on how they are used should be given.\nIn Section V and VI, extensive parameter selections and model evaluations are performed, justifying the performance of Random Forest model in accurately predicting arbitrage opportunities in advance under a 5-minute time interval. The author also concluded with the plots and results that less volatile cryptocurrencies create fewer arbitrage opportunities and lower profit, but higher predictability. In Table I and Table VII, it is not clear how the percentage change is calculated, and what values the columns \"Binance, Bybit, Total\" represent. It would be better to show both the values across a timewindow to show the percentage change. The authors show some difference of their finding with previous works, but the argument for the originality is not sufficiently justified.\nIn Section VII, the authors concludes and proposes future directions. The authors argue that the key novelty of the work lies in the demonstration of the profitability of the prediction one-time interval head. However, it does not directly connects the ML techniques the authors have used. If the authors could investigate the solutions for more volatile currencies, this work would be more intriguing and widely adoptable, since there are more volatile cryptocurrency pairs than stable ones.\n\nLanguage and format issues:\n- The authors tend to use long sentences which cause confusions. Some examples include: the last sentence in the abstract and second paragraph of the introduction.\n- The authors tend to repeat themselves frequently. E.g. In the second paragraph of introduction, the detailed definition of arbitrage is provided, but it is repeated in the first paragraph of background.\n- The authors use *this thesis* in some places (II.A. The purpose of *this thesis*; last paragraph of III, represents an inspiration and verification method for the bot implemented within *this thesis*), and *this work*. Please make it more consistent.\n- The authors defined the abbreviation \"ML\" for \"Machine Learning\" in the abstract, but never used it again. Using ML instead of Machine Learning in the main article could be helpful.\n- Last sentence in I. being *among* the first ones to take full advantage of the profit.\n- In II.B, last sentence has an additional EOS period. ...to provide implementation of algorithmic trading to the public *.* [21],[22].\n- Fig. 1. is a nice representation of the overall system design, but hard to read when printed B&W.
