        "title": "The More You Know: Energy Labels Discourage Investors from Acquiring Unsustainable Cryptocurrencies",
        "abstract": "The energy requirements of popular cryptocurrencies vary greatly: cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work (e.g. Bitcoin) consume much more electricity than their counterparts that use alternative consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (e.g. Ethereum). Even so, the former dominate the market. We investigate whether energy labelling, i.e., displaying electricity consumption information on centralised exchanges, influences consumers' product preferences. We conduct a control/treatment study: in it, participants with an interest in cryptocurrencies (N=200) are presented with a fictitious cryptocurrency exchange user interface. The treatment group is shown a user interface that displays energy labels, while the control group receives no information related to electricity consumption. Participants then declare how likely they are to acquire particular cryptocurrencies. We measure the treatment effect and find that there is a significant negative correlation (p=0.002) between being exposed to energy labels and expressing a strong preference for energy-inefficient cryptocurrencies. Based on this finding, we reflect on the sustainability issues of cryptocurrencies and discuss how energy labelling on centralised exchanges can be applied to nudge investors away from energy-inefficient cryptocurrencies.",

This is an interesting question in general. However, the main concern I have about the paper is that, apart from raising this question, the paper does little towards addressing the problem in a holistic sense. I explain this in the shortcomings section.",

The authors first come up with a hypothesis supported and validated by the experiments performed. The study in the paper states that people are more likely to favor energy-efficient cryptocurrencies when presented with the energy labels on how much electricity a specific cryptocurrency consumes. This type of study is novel and unique, and the type of questions presented to the people taking part in the survey along with the categorization of people into control/test groups is interesting."

                "The authors adopt an approach that is very similar to the approaches adopted to evaluate the influence of energy labels for other products, mainly, durable goods. This may be due to the fact that majority of the available studies are related to durable goods. However, I see this as a major shortcoming. The reason being the drastic difference in the motivation of the users that buy durable goods and the investors who buy the cryptocurrencies. The durable good provide certain functionalities that the users need to avail on a regular basis and for long-term. Therefore, when faced with choices that provide the same functionality with vaastly different energy consumption characteristics and (and is very important) in similar price range, they may be inclined to make decisions that are driven by sustainability considerations. The cryptocurrencies violate both these assumptions. Typically, different cryptocurrencies/networks cater to different use-cases. For example, the use-cases that Ethereum attracts is quite different from Bitcoin. It is also very different from use-cases that Hedera Hashgraph attracts. Therefore, they are not substitutes. Secondly, the primary motivation for buying cryptocurrencies is speculative investment lasting for much shorter duration that the typical lifespan of durable goods. Therefore, I think that it would have been better if the authors cited any study which established if sustainability criteria influenced investor's decision on buying different equities. Consider the case of two companies A and B producing substitutable products, but, with differing energy consumption properties (or sourcing strategies). Even though the investor might buy products of the company with better sustainability guarantees, the investment decision is guided by several factors (profitability, business outlook, current valuation, and so on). Therefore, I take issue with the approach adopted by the authors to test their hypothesis.\n\nIn fact, this is borne out by the experimental set-up itself. They report that the users took an average of 2 minutes to take the survey (i.e, record their choices). No serious investor would take a decision so quickly! Even though the references 68, 69 may have established cryptocurrency traders have inadequate knowledge of technology, they will definitely far more knowledgeable about the cryptocurrencies as investment options and make deliberate decisions keeping ROI as the sole consideration.",

However, later authors suggest that OTPs are stored within the authenticator. Finally, there are missing details on how to generate the OTP, there is assumed some abstract function F, and the author suggests using a cryptographic hash function and computing F_i=h(k||OPT_{i-1}), which doesn't seem a very secure option. \n\nIMO the biggest shortcoming of the presented work is the lack of rigorous definitions and specifications."

I think the problem and the approach are interesting enough and seem practical. Moreover, the authors stated there is an implementation for Ethereum and Polygon networks discussing practical applicability with respect to the gas price and upper bound limitation of the login attempts. \n\nHaving said that, I think there are quite a few shortcomings that require attention and some polishing. For instance, while describing the bootstrap mechanism, the authenticator passes a seed to the client, where the client generates OTPs. However, later authors suggest that OTPs are stored within the authenticator, which makes it a little bit confusing. \n\nAnother issue is with the way OTPs are generated. The author assumes some function F to generate the OTP, where the footnote suggests some cryptographic hash function and F_i=h(k||i). The whole security properties of the proposed solution rely on this computation, and I think it's essential to build a security model around it to outline its strength. \n\nAdditionally, in Fig.5 and the operational phase, I think there is a missing phase where the service provider validates DID of the client with the identity provider, which seems missing and misleading of why DID is mentioned and needed here in the context of this work. Also, it's unclear why to delete OPTs from the blockchain, why do not keep them to prevent the reuse of the OPTs, for instance?\n\nIt might be interesting to have an experimental setup attending performance evaluation to check how long it takes for an operation to be executed.\n\nThe idea presented in the paper is rather straightforward, so it\u2019s hard to get excited by this paper. On the more positive side: it\u2019s good to have a paper that formalizes and implements this protocol and would be glad to see this paper accepted after some shepherding. Meanwhile, I am casting my vote to weakly reject."

The designs of bridges vary and range from quite primitive to extremely complex. However, they typically consist of smart contracts holding and releasing digital assets, as well as nodes that help facilitate user interactions between chains.

This system also helps to reduce medical insurance costs because people will have a longer, higher quality life from doing more physical activity such as walking, hiking, swimming and running. The system comprises of a wireless wearable device, a decentralized application with a user interface and a smart contract in the block-chain. The wearable device has an anti-fraud algorithm embedded inside. A new method called \"Proof of Physical Activity\" (PoPA) is introduced in this system to replace the useless \"Proof of Work\" (PoW), PoPA is applied to calculate the real value of a block in the block-chain.

It is crypto-backed in the sense that the bank keeps a volatile cryptocurrency in its reserve. The reserve is used to buy stablecoins from users that want to sell them. And revenue from sales of stablecoins to users is stored in the reserve. Besides stablecoins, the protocol also trades reservecoins in order to capitalize itself and maintain a reserve ratio significantly greater than one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implemented stablecoin protocol where stability claims are precisely and mathematically stated and proven. Furthermore, the claims and their proofs are formally verified using two different techniques: bounded model checking, to exhaustively search for counterexamples to the claims or to establish invariant satisfaction; and interactive theorem proving, to build rigorous formal proofs using a proof assistant with automated theorem proving features.",

Under these conditions, certain properties hold true for the protocol and remain robust throughout. This robustness is the result of formal verification techniques presented.\n\nHowever, the paper presents some definitions that work well within the scope of the paper but raises questions in the mind of the reader. One of them is that the payoff price of the stablecoin which can go below the target price if the value of the reserves shrinks. Under such a definition of the stablecoin price, protocol liabilities are defined and then proven that the protocol always remain solvent. In a practical scenario, a stablecoin protocol should always gurantee a target price and if this promise is not fulfilled, the protocol is deemed insolvent. Therefore, the proof of solvency, under the given definition, does not add great significance to the protocol.\n\nIt is clear that in case of lowering base coin value leading to a reserve ratio less than 1, the equity of the protocol becomes zero which then attracts investors to purchase reserve coins and increase reserves of the protocol in expectation for a higher future payoff for reserve coins. This serves as an important mechanism to bring back the stablecoin price back to its target price in the scenario of falling base coin value. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the interest of the investors to purchase reserve coins to design a long term sustainable protocol and this could be added to the present work."

        "abstract": "Classical and contemporary distributed consensus protocols, may they be for binary agreement, state machine replication, or blockchain consensus, require all protocol participants in a peer-to-peer system to output (agree on) exactly the same information as part of the consensus payload. Although this model of consensus is extensively studied, and is useful for most consensus based decentralized applications, it falls short of defining correct distributed systems which mandate participant credential based privileged visibility into the consensus payload, through the consensus protocol itself. We introduce a new paradigm for permissioned blockchain consensus, called functional blockchain consensus. Functional blockchain consensus allows each blockchain protocol participant to output some distinct sub-information of the list of transactions, as a function of the credentials of the participant in the blockchain system, instead of outputting the entire list of transactions. We motivate a novel rational-fault adversary to compromise functional blockchain consensus, and present a blockchain protocol called SIGHTSTEEPLE, that achieves functional blockchain consensus in the said fault model. SIGHT-STEEPLE relies on a novel combination of standard blockchain consensus and functional encryption, among other primitives, to achieve its goal of correctness. Further, we outline the realization of novel decentralized applications through functional blockchain consensus.",

        "abstract": "In second-hand vehicle markets, blockchains are being proposed as means to provide verification of vehicle history, a.k.a. vehicle passport (VP). However, given that confidentiality of VPs often contradicts public verification, blockchains are not used to their full potential in the proposed frameworks. Specifically, although blockchain smart contracts offer a decentralized mechanism for untrusted parties to fairly exchange digital assets without the need for a trusted third party, VP exchange is always carried off-chain. In this work, we investigate the problem of \"fair exchange\" of confidential VPs over public blockchains where its plain information must be verified against its publicly committed value. We propose a zero-knowledge proof, called Consistent Commitment Encryption (CCE), that enables the public verification of the consistency between ElGamal encryption of a given VP and its Pedersen commitment. We employ our CCE to build vPass, a decentralized vehicle passport framework that enables second-hand vehicle buyers to purchase vehicle history information from designated service providers and get it verified and delivered on-chain while preserving its confidentiality. The security of CCE relies on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem in elliptic curve groups and it has no trusted setup. We formally prove that CCE is sound, complete, and witness indistinguishable proof of knowledge, and report on comparisons with other generic proof systems. Moreover, we show that vPass provides fair exchange and confidentiality of the vehicle history, and compare it to existing VP systems. Finally, we provide a proof of concept implementation on Ethereum and report the system performance metrics.",

                "The paper has a number of major shortcomings that cannot overcome without substantial improvements to the paper. \n1. The model of the consensus itself is not presented in a formal and understandable manner (referring to Section 3). This section, which should have presented the formal model of consensus and trust assumptions does not present any of that. It is riddled with badly written and confusing statements. A sample of such statements are below:\n  1A. \"Among them, the main chain is made of blocks that continually generate additional blocks\"!!! -- what does this mean?\n  1B. \"The main chainblocks do not contain transactions, but, are used to confirm the latest states of the subchains\"!!! -- what does this mean? There is a need to clearly and explicitly state what does the main chain contain if not the transactions themselves. Is it commitments? If so, what kind of commitments. Different commitment schemes have different capabilities in terms of the properties that they allow an interested party to verify. They also have different overheads. \n 1C. \"The receiver claims the receiving fund on another subchain by reference to the main chainblock and sending transaction\" - this is very confusing. When every subchain is supposed to be account-centric, shouldnt the receiver specifically claim it on the sending subchain? If so, what mechanism is there to assure that the sender will honor the request? Further, does \"claiming\" become a separate transaction? If not, are transactions implemented using some kind of locking mechanisms and smart contracts? If so, what are they? The authors do not provide any of these highly relevant details.\n 1D. \"Depending on their storage capacity, each node store only a portion of the shards\"!! - again this very confusing to say the least. Which node is being referred here? Is it the node responsible for the subchain itself? If yes, then, where is the full ledger of data being maintained? If it not that node responsible for the subchain, then, isnt it a violation of the claim that only one node is maintaining each subchain?\n 1E. The authors say they want to avoid token during consensus. But, why?\n2. From a broader literature perspective, the authors do not even specify whether they are interested in permissionless blockchains or permissioned blockchains. This is very important as there is a very rich body of work on consensus for permissioned networks.\n3. In fact, there is no coverage of the literature on consensus for state machine replication (aks PBFT and its derivatives). In that literature, there are consensus algorithms that have established throughput in execess of 10K tps. \n4. Even in the permissionless world, each account does not operate a node (in fact, that would make it impossible for light clients like individual users to participate). The authors do not explain why it is justifiable to use a shard for each private account.\n5. The biggest problem is that the authors do not explain what are the trust implications of having just single account shards to be responsible for their own subchains (in fact, this is the reasons for objections raised in 1C).",
                "The paper's content remains vague, does not include the level of technical detail needed to understand how \"unlimited\" number of shards can be maintained in operation, and the experiments described cannot be reenacted with the details provided earlier in the paper.

So it can appear to be a solution (application of DECO protocol) in search of a new problem, rather than the best solution for it. As a result, it is less ambitious than approaches that attempt to rethink the entire web PKI CA architecture. Having said that, while it does aim to be compatible with existing PKI systems, ADO protocol is a modification of ACME's DNS-01, and so it is not a drop-in replacement. As a result, its advantage may be reduced as it may be cumbersome to implement or to switch to, and this also raises practical challenges of incentives for provers and verifiers to abandon existing PKI.

        "abstract": "With the advancement of blockchain systems, many recent research works have proposed distributed ledger technology (DLT) that employs Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols to decide which block to append next to the ledger. Notably, BFT consensus can offer high performance, energy efficiency, and provable correctness properties, and it is thus considered a promising building block for creating highly resilient and performant blockchain infrastructures. Yet, a major ongoing challenge is to make BFT consensus applicable to large-scale environments. A large body of recent work addresses this challenge by developing novel ideas to improve the scalability of BFT consensus, thus opening the path for a new generation of BFT protocols tailored to the needs of blockchain. In this survey, we create a systematization of knowledge about the novel scalability-enhancing techniques that state-of-the-art BFT consensus protocols use. For our comparison, we closely analyze the efforts, assumptions, and trade-offs these protocols make.",

In this paper, we make use of the referable NFT (rNFT 1 ) standard [2], indexed EIP-5521, to construct an rNFT classification framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN), an emerging branch of Deep Learning (DL), which learns on the inherent topology of graph-based data. In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges.

For example, from the EIP page, a remix song NFT A could refer to two NFT songs B and C, and those two songs should be aware that A refers them. The paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) to classify rNFTs and a recommender system as an applicative example of their GNN model. The paper lacks of experiments validating the GNN model since they are planned by the authors.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not familiar with machine learning and neural network technologies, therefore I am not able to judge the GNN model the authors propose.\n\nGiven the lack of experiments, I cannot get the goal of the classifier.\n- The author mentioned that a platform such as OpenSea has a manual classification system with limited labels. Therefore, the authors propose the GNN to automatically classify NFTs. Page 2 suggests users searching for NFTs with identical labels. These labels could be stored in an array in the EIP-5521 as customizable data.  At page 3 the authors propose to use NFT data such as ID, owner address, value, transaction data such as \"from\" address and \"to\" address, and the referring 5521 information to construct the DAG.\n- What is the goal of the classifier? From page 2 and the description of the model at end of page 3 I think the goal is the application of labels such as \"artwork\", \"song\", \"animation\", etc (the examples listed at page 2) to NFTs. Page 3 also lists other input data, including token data such as the ID, transaction data such as sender and recipient addresses, and the EIP-5521 referral data. However, how this data help to learn labels such as \"artwork\"? \n- The \"labels\" are not data part of the ERC-721 standard, the most popular for NFTs, and also in the EIP 5521 they are part of the customizable attributes set. Would not it be a risk to train the GNN on a dataset with records, the labels, that is it not representative of the majority of the NFT market?\n- It is not clear if the model the authors propose is specific for rNFTs or for NFTs in general. What is the added value of rNFT information to the model? What kind of output the model would produce if executed over NFT contracts that are not rNFT?\n\nI am not totally convinced on the motivation the authors bring about rNFTs. The authors state \"Practically, rNFT has attracted increasing discussions and attention on forums [8] and by several projects (e.g., Briq [9]) that have potential collaboration opportunities.\". I could find very little information about EIP-5521, probably due to their very recent proposal. Reference [8] is a post with 6 replies arguing the need of the timestamp integer in the standard, while Briq [9] is an incomplete site about NFTs and I could not find any mentioning about rNFTs inside. Therefore, this sentence seems to me a bit exaggerated.\n\nI do not suggest the the acceptance of the article as a publication due to its unclear goal and contribution. I suggest the authors to better indicate the goal of the classifier and to explain why they focus on rNFTs and not NFTs since they claim \"In this work, we are the first study to leverage the GNN technique for analyzing NFT markets.\". In what way rNFT data, such as referred and referring, helps the classification of labels?",

        "abstract": "Account abstraction allows a contract wallet to initiate transaction execution.  It can reduce the gas costs associated with issuing transactions because it can remove a transaction issued from a user to the contract wallet. Thus, account abstraction is useful for preserving the privacy of externally owned accounts. However, unconditional anonymity is undesirable in practice because it prevents to reveal who is accountable for a problem when it arises. Thus, maintaining a balancing between anonymity and accountability is important. In this paper, we propose an anonymous yet accountable contract wallet system. In addition to account abstraction, the proposed system also utilizes accountable ring signatures. The proposed system provides (1) anonymity of a transaction issuer that hides who agreed with running the contract wallet, and (2) accountability of the issuer, which allows the issuer to prove they agreed with running the contract wallet. Moreover, due to a security requirement of accountable ring signatures, the transaction issuer cannot claim that someone else issued the transaction. This functionality allows us to clarify the accountability involved in issuing a transaction. In addition, the proposed system allows an issuer to employ a typical signature scheme, e.g., ECDSA, together with the ring signature scheme. This functionality can be considered an extension of the common multi-signatures that require a certain number of ECDSA signatures to run a contract wallet. The proposed system was implemented using zkSync (Solidity). We discuss several potential applications of the proposed system, i.e., medical information sharing and asset management.",

Whereas previous studies have focused on myopic miners, we here focus on strategic miners in the sense of miners being able to reason about the future blocks. We derive expressions for optimal miner behavior (in terms of setting block sizes) in the case of 2-block foresight and varying degrees of hashing power. Results indicate that a sufficiently large mining pool will have enough hashing power to gain by strategic foresight. We further use a simulation study to examine the impact of both 2-block and 3-block foresight. In particular, the simulation study indicates that for realistic levels of hashing power, mining pools do not gain from being able to reason more than 2 blocks ahead. Moreover, even though the presence of strategic miners increase the variation in block sizes and potentially empty blocks, overall system throughput tend to increase slightly compared to myopic mining.",

                "As mentioned in the summary, the simulation part could be strengthened by looking at more realistic data and miner behavior.\nAdditionally, I found the treatment of 3-block farsighted miners somewhat confusing. As the author state themselves, intuitively, a 3-block farsighted miner should be at least as powerful as a 2-block farsighted miner. The rationale is that a 3-block farsighted miner simply needs a good strategy to decide whether its additional knowledge brings a benefit. If it doesn't, it can use the strategy of the 2-block farsighted miner.\nThe authors argue that the 3-block farsighted miner performs worse, essentially because there are fewer 3-block segments than 2-block segments. I don't find this argument convincing because a miner can look at the blocks in a \"sliding-window fashion\", changing its strategy after every block. Moreover, the authors state themselves that \"the 3-block farsighted miner could potentially have done slightly better if allowed to play an optimal strategy\". Under what conditions is a 3-block farsighted miner really weaker than a 2-block farsighted miner? It would be great if the authors could clarify this.\n\nWhile the paper is generally well written, there are a few minor issues:\n- P.2: through-put -> throughput\n- P.2: up-dates -> updates\n- P.2: EIP1559 were first (no comma)\n- P.2: \"in Roughgarden\" -> This should be a citation.\n- P.2: dubbed as \"burning...\"/the elevator -> dubbed \"burning...\"/the elevator\n- P.2: can be found several places -> can be found in several places\n- P.3: miner prefer -> miner prefers\n- P.3: boils down finding -> boils down to finding\n- P.4: Let the networks total hashing power -> Let the network's total hashing power\n- P.4: Figure 2 is trivial and can be removed or replaced with more relevant content. \n- P.4: will do better than the myopic miner -> will do better than the myopic miner in expectation\n- P.5: i.e., 8.5 -> i.e., b = 8.5\n- P.5: rest of the network are -> rest of the network is\n- P.6: the miner only have -> the miner only has\n- P.6, 7, 8: Figure 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 should be improved: The legends are barely readable when printed and it's hard to determine which line is which in a grayscale print.\n- P.6: as the ... increases then the number ... -> as the ... increases, the number ...\n- P.7: 1000 the blocks -> 1000 blocks\n- P.8: ... blocks kept the same -> ... blocks were kept the same",

        "abstract": "People have been working on secure methods to archive files online. Above all, the storage of confidential and personal files must be treated very carefully and thoroughly. Since the advent of cloud storage services, safekeeping has become immensely important. Other properties, such as searching in encrypted data or processing encrypted information, can theoretically already be implemented. This ensures with a high degree of probability that the file in plain text format cannot be read by unauthorized people. However, cloud services must be trusted. Because the moment the data is on the cloud, the cloud providers own the data. So how do you find out that a file has not been touched and misused by either cyber attackers or cloud providers themselves? Security should therefore be supplemented with the property of traceability in order to reliably support the owner with tamper-proof logging of interactions with its files. If logging is centralized, there is a hypothetical possibility of manipulating that logging by the central authority. Another possibility is presented, which is still important, regardless of the chosen encryption. Recognizing read and write access and, if necessary, identifying the respective entity of the corresponding activity via blockchain technology. With the help of blockchain technology, tamper-proof traceability is to be designed and implemented in order to enforce traceability independently, automatically, and decentralized. The results show that blockchain technology has the right to exist as a supplementary technology to the database in the tamper-proof logging of interactions and can be used in a targeted manner.",

        "title": "Ensemble Learning to Enhance Continuous User Authentication For Real World Environments",
        "abstract": "The latest digital applications/systems need robust cybersecurity solutions. Traditional authentication methods authenticate the user at the beginning of the session but there is no validation during the session, which makes the system vulnerable. Continuous authentication is the solution to this challenge. In continuous authentication, keystroke data is used to extract the behavior patterns of the user. The data are then applied to train the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to identify the unique behavioral patterns of each user and classify them accordingly. Thus, the performance of the ML classification algorithm is key here, and it requires diverse and comprehensive data to be effective in the production environment. In many cases, the ML algorithm is trained on the datasets collected in a controlled lab environment and the model fails or does not perform as expected in the production environment. For example, China's facial recognition system recognized the face on a bus ad as a jaywalker because the model was not trained on real-world data. To overcome this problem, this study uses the real-world data of 48 of a financial organization's employees to compare the prediction accuracy and prediction delay of advanced ML algorithms. Among all the individual models, LightGBM performed best with an accuracy of 23.58% and a delay of 34.4 sec. However, some ML models were better at predicting particular sets of users than others, hence ensemble learning was used to combine the prediction ability of all the models, which increased cumulative accuracy to 24.03% with a delay of 43.51sec.",

Although the verification technologies catch huge attention from the research communities, applying the most strict method to every piece of software component is not affordable for small projects, especially among the DApp development communities. In order to balance the project progress and the security concerns, this work tries to explain the role of verification techniques in the context of risk management, which attaches a clear gain of value to each verification purpose and methodology. By analysing a general DApp architecture, this work shows three main risk factors leading to users' negative utilities -- the logic fault in the software, the breach of security assumption conducted by hackers, and the shortage of computation/network resources compared to the service volume. For each factor, the responsible components in the DApp architecture are identified and assigned an economic loss based on the real-time price of lost assets as well as the shrink of market capitalization which reflects the reduced reputation of the project. The way to estimate exposure probability of each risk factor is discussed separately. Based on the analysis above, the verification methods are regarded as risk mitigation approaches. Since each methods behaves differently in the risk mitigation -- time/money investment relationship, an optimistic verification method choice exists to reach the best security gain.",

In this paper, we present a new Layer2 blockchain called W3Chain, which is promising to deliver high transactions per second (TPS) while defeating the scalability trilemma of a public blockchain. To enable the claimed performance, we particularly design our W3Chain by decoupling the correctness of the blockchain into two parts and adopting several crucial technical issues such as the reconfiguration of committees, the design of query APIs, and the handling of cross-shard transactions. We also propose a Time-Beacon Chain (TBChain) to record pivotal data of W3Chain. To show the correctness and safety features, we rigorously analyze multiple properties of W3Chain, including decentralization, scalability, and security under typical attacks. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations using Ethereum's historical transactions to examine the proposed W3Chain. The evaluation results show that our W3Chain can achieve a TPS as high as 10K+, and much lower transaction confirmation latency compared with Ethereum.",

This content would be useful as an industry report for a non-technical audience, but produces no technical novelty or insight for the ICBC audience.\n\nThe main technical discourse came at the end, but I found that not too relevant, or unconvincing. Figuring out mining incentives in Ethereum (or similarly designed system) is an interesting problem in itself, but given that several other technologies and incentive frameworks exist, the authors don't substantiate why this is the main blocker for the use of blockchain in financial services in general. They also basically assert that the EOS blockchain technology is ideal for financial services without even describing that technology or doing a proper technical comparison with other better known and widely used technologies.

However, the whole paper summarizes and analyses existing Blockchain applications and threats in general, it fails to present the specific opportunities, requirements and limitations of using Blockchain technology in the GBA. For example, \n- Are there any existing Blockchain products/platforms applied in the GBA? What are their benefits and shortcomings?\n- What support can be offered from different parties to booster Blockchain adoption, e.g. local government, financial companies, technical companies, etc.\n- What issues in GBA is hindering Blockchain adoption, such as the acceptance of citizens, hardware limitations, regulations and so on.\n\n2. The problem description or research motivation of this paper is too limited to justify the topic. Currently it only describes the geographical features of GBA, what are other problems can be solved or what benefits will bring by using Blockchain.\n\n3.

                "General comments: You go into a tangent about finding the right incentive for miners in a (seemingly public) blockchain system (like Ethereum). Given the mix of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies available that are not build on mining rewards and have been tested by industries and consortia, and which you also survey in Section V, I don't see why we need to focus inordinately on that aspect. There are private or permissioned versions of Ethereum too, where mining rewards are not relevant, and which could also form the basis for financial applications. It seems you take it for granted that a public mining rewards-based network is the only basis for financial services, but you haven't justified that claim in your paper. I would encourage you to read more about the actual networks managing financial services that have been built on various kinds of blockchain technology, and you can then analyze whether and how much mining incentives proved to be relevant. Also, if you had provided some specific info about the needs and challenges of China's Greater Bay Area, your contribution would have been more useful. As such, it's hard to see why the claims you make are relevant only to that area and not applicable more universally.\n\nSpecific comments:\n- Page 1: \"Electro-Optical System (EOS)\": need to add a citation or footnote.\n- Page 2: \"Existing insurance systems have already archived\": \"archived\" --> \"achieved\"\n- Page 3: Section II.C: I can recommend related work that deals with protecting confidential data on blockchain in an access-controlled manner: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8360358. You can add this to your survey.\n- Page 3: Section II.F: What does \"monotony\" mean in this context? In the following paragraph, please cite or footnote your claim about P2P platforms becoming substitutes for banks.\n- Page 4: Section II.H: You need to substantiate \"Blockchain is a natural carrier for IoT devices\". There are lots of reasons (including those mentioned by you later) why this may not be be the case: for scalability, security, and privacy reasons, not to mention resource constraints on many IoT devices in the wild. I'm also not sure how ShadowEth is relevant to IoT relying on blockchain.\n- Page 5: Section II.J: You should survey and cite actual trade finance networks built on blockchain or DLT here. Like We.Trade (now reached end of life) and Marco Polo (still active).\n- Page 5: Section II.K: R3 did not launch Corda \"recently\". It's been around since the end of 2015 or early 2016. Also, it's by no means the only distributed ledger technology that considers and provides support for consortium governance. Hyperledger Fabric also does that. As do almost all DLTs built on the permissioned model. There are permissioned forms of Ethereum as well: Quorum and Besu (playing different roles in the stack.)\n- Page 6: Section III: Define \"cross-chain problems\". There is a rich literature on this, as part of the general interoperability problem, that you have not covered at all in this paper.\n- Page 6: Section IV: \"permissioned Blockchain can not rely on tokenized money.....\": this is not true, strictly speaking. Again, do survey the recent research on blockchain and DLT interoperability, on bridges, relays, etc.\n- Page 7: Section V: \"hope to identify the most suitable...\": industry experience over the past half a decade or more suggests this is not a fruitful quest. Considering a mix of technologies (and interoperability) is probably more useful if you want scale.\n- Page 7: Section V: \"regulatory concerns in areas such as competition.....\": I couldn't understand this part; also it deserves a citation or two.\n- Page 8: Section V: You have mixed throughput and consistency considerations in one bucket, when the two can (and ought to be) dealt with separately. Though the latter does affect the former.\n- Page 8: Section V: You need to describe EOS rather than just assert that it is the answer to all our problems, and do a point-by-point technical comparison with other technologies in your list. Also, the claim that \"public Blockchain is better suited....\" ignores industry experience and research on interoperability, as mentioned earlier. (Not to say that public blockchain may not be the ultimate answer, but that's not a claim that can be made on current evidence.)",

The term is now being coined against blockchain technology and its applications such as Bitcoin [1] and Ethereum [2] which decentralizes financial transactions and smart contracts respectively. With growing concerns about centralized cloud storage providers' access to private data, researchers are exploring DSNs (Decentralized Storage Networks) and are developing blockchain based DSNs with scalability, security and efficiency (power and storage). Current DSN projects are highly unscalable because of their complexity, insufficient storage consensus mechanism, and inefficient redundant policy. \nWe propose ZDS, a novel DSN that is highly scalable because of its novel ZK-PoS (Zero Knowledge Proof of Storage) consensus mechanism. ZK-PoS offers data reliability by storing redundant data copies and data anonymity in the network. We also present a python-based event driven ZDS simulator with this paper.",

        "abstract": "An increasingly common application for DLTs is their exploitation in enterprise systems operated by a consortium of organizations, who may assume different roles and whose interaction takes place over a blockchain network (in this scope, often permissioned), which holds a data state that they need to query frequently. In this regard, one of the main drawbacks of DLTs is their unsuitability for the efficient execution of complex queries on the data stored by the nodes comprising the network.\nArising from this issue, many solutions propose to dump the ledger contents into databases, which, due to their own nature and purpose, are certainly optimized for the execution of such queries. However, most proposals on this area are not intended for querying the shared state held by the network, just the transaction history. Actually, through conducting a study on the state of the art, a lack of support for handling and querying complex structured data has been identified.\nDELTA provides a solution for the synchronization, with negligible overload, of the state of a DLT into a database, enabling (a) the operation with smart contracts whose data possess a complex structure and (b) the efficient execution of elaborate queries on these data. By using DELTA, query times decrease, at least, between one and five orders of magnitude, depending on the DLT, compared to queries directed to the ledger nodes.",

The authors claim that their approach allows the system to recover form node failure and resync with the DLT, and can also resync the entire DLT from scratch.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains are disrupting traditional finance by reducing the number of intermediaries and providing transparency. Blockchains, however, come with their own set of prominent issues. One such challenge is frontrunning. Attackers try to influence the transaction order so that their transaction executes before their victims' transaction. While frontrunning is a well-studied topic on Ethereum, it is unknown whether other blockchains are also susceptible to such attacks.\n\nOne proposed defence strategy against frontrunning attacks is to randomize the transaction execution order. XRP Ledger is the highest-value blockchain to use such a strategy. Furthermore, it runs a Decentralized Exchange, which provides ample frontrunning opportunities. Therefore, in the context of XRP Ledger, we examine whether randomized transaction order provides sufficient protection against frontrunning.\n\nOur results show that the mechanism embedded in the XRP Ledger protocol is insufficient to prevent these attacks. We showcase two strategies to perform frontrunning attacks. The first, \"naive\" strategy, uses randomly generated accounts, whereas the second uses carefully selected accounts to improve the attack's success. Based on our analysis of the XRP Ledgers' historical data, we estimate that attackers could generate up to approx. 1.4M USD profit over two months, provided they succeeded to frontrun every opportunity.",

As a blockchain conference, it is assumed that the reader knows the basics. Not all blockchains have a \"merkle root\". \n-The related work should be enhanced. For example, on decision models \"uitable decentralised and transparent platform for multiple experts for knowledge exchange and data accessibility management.\" can be decomposed into several areas with different contributions. \n-In the related work the authors can point out that typically the data stored on chain is a hash of the file that is stored off chain, for accountability. \n-Background on GDPR and CCPA is poor given its importance in the paper. What about considerations on data protection, data security, and transparency? Moreover, the GDPR requires that organizations have a legal basis for processing personal data. In blockchain this is not trivial.\n Only the right to be forgotten is mentioned.

The authors should consider another way to present the data acquisition process\n\n-What is the description of the blockchain environment? Why have the authors opted for Hyperledger Fabric? How are the chaincodes implemented? Open-sourcing the code would be useful but if not possible, the authors should describe what the code does. \n\n-My biggest concern about the paper is that it proposes to \"to develop a secure knowledge management service which addresses the challenges imposed by European and US data protection laws and high onchain computational costs.\" and yet this is not present in the evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is widely considered as a promising solution, which can build a secure and efficient environment for data sharing. With more and more people working remotely and privacy becoming a major concern, having a secure and efficient way of sharing data has become a necessity. Blockchain being a decentralized ledger emphasizing cryptography obviously helps with data security and privacy, but the technology can suffer from major constraints in the context of data sharing such as on-chain data volume, storage, network performance, off-chain security and more.  In this study, as part of the project BLOCKUSTOM, we explore the relevant research questions and the metrics/parameters by implementing a proof-of-concept solution using Hyperledge-fabric and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). The results show that the on-chain data transfer duration increases with some exception with rising data size, whereas the off-chain duration decreases with respect to on-chain ratio, but NOT linearly. This leads to a balance customization problem depending on the data amount required to be on-chain (to be more secure), the infrastructure, the performance requirement, and some other metrics. Indeed, by analyzing the data, whether it's big or small data to share, we aim to help in deciding which data should be shared on-chain depending on its size if the said data should be divided in smaller files beforehand. The goal is to offer an optimal solution for data sharing; passing the data type, volume and the chain metrics as input parameters, one could provide the best configuration in terms of performance and security.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized apps (DApps) often hold significant cryptocurrency assets. In order to manage these assets and coordinate joint investments, shareholders leverage the underlying smart contract functionality to realize a transparent, verifiable, and secure decision-making process. That is, DApps implement proposal-based voting. Permissionless blockchains, however, lead to a conflict between transparency and anonymity; potentially preventing free decision-making if individual votes and intermediate results become public. In this paper, we therefore present Tornado Vote, a voting DApp for anonymous, fair, and practical voting on the Ethereum blockchain. We propose to use a cryptocurrency mixer such as Tornado Cash to reconcile transparency and anonymity. To this end, we adapt Tornado Cash and develop a voting protocol that implements a fair voting process. While Tornado Vote can technically process 10 k votes on Ethereum in approximately two hours, this is not feasible under realistic conditions: Third-party transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet reduce the possible throughput, and transaction fees make it infeasible to use all available block capacities. We therefore present various Gas cost models that yield lower bounds and economic estimations with respect to the required number of blocks and voting costs to assess and adjust Tornado Vote's feasibility trade-off.",

        "abstract": "Offchain payment channel networks (PCNs) represent one of the leading techniques to scale the transaction throughput in cryptocurrencies. Two participants can use a bidirectional payment channel to make multiple mutual payments without committing them to the blockchain. Opening a payment channel is a slow operation that involves an on chain transaction locking a certain amount of funds. These aspects limit the number of channels that can be opened or maintained. Users may route payments through a multi-hop path and thus avoid opening and maintaining a channel for each new destination. Unlike regular networks, in PCNs capacity depends on the usage patterns, moreover, channels may become unidirectional. Since payments often fail due to channel depletion, a protection scheme to overcome failures is of interest. We define the stopping time of a payment channel to be the time at which the channel becomes depleted. We analyze the mean failure time of a channel and a set of channel and examine it in particular topologies and propose a scheme for optimizing the capacity distribution between the channels. We conduct experiments to evaluate our model and optimization scheme.",

Blockchain's safe decentralization can solve the IoT ecosystem's security, authentication, and maintenance constraints.

This blockchain enables the transmission of binary data and the data logging of the (PLC) networks' signals.

We provide models on this so-called orphanage of blocks and validate these through open-sourced simulation studies.

These days, real estate administration uses only centralized databases, which gives the people no choice of technology for managing their property rights. Decentralized distributed ledgers are the key element to achieving full decentralization, while they also bring more security to the automatization of legal processes. The automatization also allows to cut loose many intermediary participants in these legal processes, which can not only save time, but also resources. This paper is build around this problem and provides a theoretical and practical solution for a decentralized real estate marketplace.

Gradually, more and more countries are trying to replace old paper archives with a digital database in the government management. The new approach to land records reduces the risk of data manipulation and misuse of this information. This problem can be simply solved by implementing a blockchain in the land cadastre. Blockchain, as a distributed public ledger, can handle the above mentioned problems and ensure that the information in the cadastre cannot be manipulated. In addition, it is a good way to simplify all operations related to the sale and purchase of real estate, it can save a lot of time and unnecessary costs for third parties by using smart contracts",

Thus, the space with this section could be better utilized by detailing a different background aspect of the approach or related work.\n- Technical details of the implementation of the proposal are provided in a very brief manner in the paper. Hence, one cannot attest to the paper's contribution and difference to the state-of-the-art, which is also brief.\n- The related work research is very short for a paper that details a well-studied use case for blockchain.\n- The authors are comparing their solution to a government-sponsored project in Estonia that has been being developed and tested since 2012. Unfortunately, with 6 pages and a lack of technical details of the approach, the claim that the system solves the shortcomings of such systems cannot be confirmed. Further, such a proposal might introduce other crucial shortcomings; for example, the owner's email is stored publicly in the blockchain without any encryption, which in turn could be used by attackers to send spam messages or scam emails.\n- Several aspects need to be included; for example, what are the permissions of the system, and who is allowed to write in the smart contract?

        "abstract": "The average cryptocurrency user today faces a difficult choice between centralized custodial wallets, which are notoriously prone to spontaneous collapse, or cumbersome self-custody solutions, which if not managed properly can cause a total loss of funds. In this paper, we present a \"best of both worlds\" cryptocurrency wallet design that looks like, and inherits the user experience of, a centralized custodial solution, while in fact being entirely decentralized in design and implementation. In our design, private keys are not stored on any device, but are instead derived directly from a user's authentication factors, such as passwords, soft tokens (e.g., Google Authenticator), hard tokens (e.g., YubiKey), or out-of-band authentication (e.g., SMS). Public parameters (salts, one-time pads, etc.) needed to access the wallet can be safely stored in public view, such as on a public blockchain, thereby providing strong availability guarantees. Users can then simply \"log in\" to their decentralized wallet on any device using standard credentials and even recover from lost credentials, thereby providing the usability of a custodial wallet with the trust and security of a decentralized approach.",

        "abstract": "Across industries, there is an ever-increasing rate of data sharing for collaboration and innovation between organizations and their customers, partners, suppliers, and internal teams. However, many enterprises are restricted from freely sharing data due to regulatory restrictions across different regions, performance issues in moving large volume data, or requirements to maintain autonomy. In such situations, the enterprise can benefit from the concept of federated learning, in which machine learning models are constructed at various geographic sites. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, namely BDSP, to share data among enterprises based on Blockchain and federated learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a transparency contribution accounting mechanism to estimate the valuation of data and implement a proof-of-concept for further evaluation. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed BDSP has a competitive performance with higher training accuracy, an increase of over 5%, and lower communication overhead, reducing 3 times, compared to baseline approaches.",

I enjoyed the first part of your paper and got disappointed starting Section IV.\nI believe you did great job on the intro and introducing federated learning, but when describing the architecture and the flow of your framework, the quality and accuracy of your writing were dropping. \n\nI don't see how this paper fulfils the claim to introduce a \"general framework to share data among enterprises\". The claim is very generic, but your approach describes how to do federated learning using a blockchain to exchange model updates.\n\nFigure 2 is not really intuitive as it shows two things in a single figure. I suggest to split into i) conventional sharing and ii) BDSP\n\nHow does Figure 3 help to understand the problem you are trying to solve?\n\nCould you elaborate on how the SMOTE method works as you use it in III.B re-balancing. What is {knn} ???\n\nFigure 4 has some naming inconsistencies with the text in IV.A\n\nYou mention the use of external services in Sec IV.A. I would recommend to name it just external storage and describe this component independent of the actual implementation, in your case IPFS. This should then appear in your evaluation section. \n\nIn Sec IV.B - Step 1): Shouldn't this also resemble in a transaction to define the \"genesis\" model? That is, when another B_j downloads the initial model for updating, it should consult the ledger to verify it has received the correct model. Also, you don't mention that now your \"external service\" is used to share the model data.  \nIn Step 3) you mention the first time blockchain miners. What are those? In your prototype evaluation you use Hyperledger Fabric, which does not have something like miners at all. In particular, you also mention that selected orgs can submit trained local models (aka  model updates?!) to the aggregator. Who is the aggregator in your case? What component is performing the aggregation? You say: \"... miners record this model and the ... ledger via smart contract features\"? What do you mean here? What are smart contract features? I thought we want to use IPFS to store the bulk data?!\nStep 4) Who assigns Bj to pick a Blockchain validator? What is a Blockchain validator? How can it aggregate the global model? This is really unclear? Have you really implemented something like that and it did work? Sorry to ask this question.\n\nAre you using a single machine for your experiments? Table III shows 5 components - but what is the difference between HL Fabric and HLF Peer? Should it be version v2.4.0 instead of v.24? Is Pytorch a version? :P\nIt is wired to read that you use Fabric to simulate a blockchain. I suggest to rewrite this section. How did you implement the chaincode? \n\nTable II shows a bunch of parameters which are not introduced before. What are we evaluating here? Are those parameters relevant to evaluate the performance of your general architecture or just for a specific component - the aggregation?!\n\nWhat are epochs? First introduced in the Sec V.B Results. Are these things relevant for your overall framework? What about the overhead introduced by the distributed ledger? Adding additional communication? \n\nTypos:\n\n- \"demonstrated in section II.\"\n- \"the encrypted of f can be computed by ...\"\n- make use of ~ to prevent nasty splits. E.g., \"in Section~\\ref{your ref }\"\n- learning rate n^t vs \\n in (5)\n- In Algo (6): Should it be sum of w_i^t+1 ?\n- \"For example, Fig .3 shows\"\n- \"B.

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has found applications for myriad use cases. Proof-of-Stake(PoS) based blockchain protocols have gained popularity due to their higher throughput and low carbon footprint when compared with Proof-of-Work blockchain protocols. The two major parts of blockchain protocols is selection of the next block proposer and selection of the longest chain. In the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, block publishers are selected based on their relative stake. However, PoS-based blockchain protocols may face vulnerability against Fully Adaptive Corruptions.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync, to achieve security against Fully Adaptive Corruptions while improving performance. Towards this, we propose a metric for each block: block power. This is a function of the block publisher's stake derived from a verifiable random function (VRF) output. We compute the chain power of a chain as the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain. The chain selection rule selects the chain with the highest chain power as the valid chain. Since block proposer is not selected upfront, this scheme is resilient to fully adaptive corruptions, which we also show formally. We also ensure that our block power mechanism is resistant to Sybil attacks. We prove the security of QuickSync by showing that it satisfies the common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties. We also show its resilience against different adversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync performs better than Bitcoin by order of magnitude on both transactions per second and time to finality.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin futures by comparing one form of the constant model, the conventional OLS method, with the time-varying model in estimating the optimal hedge ratio. For the time-varying model, we employ a powerful technique, Kalman filter, a recursive algorithm which has numerous real-time, technological applications, but has not been employed in the context of Bitcoin optimal hedge ratio analysis. Through applying the spot and futures daily settlement prices from 18th December 2017 to 30th November 2022 to the two models, we confirm that the Bitcoin futures is an effective instrument for risk hedging. Additionally, we find the dynamic model based on the Kalman filter performs better - especially in 2019 and 2020 - than the conventional OLS method in terms of risk reduction, supporting previous findings in the context of other commodity futures. We also certify that the Kalman filter successfully captures the trend of the optimal hedge ratio, thus enabling hedgers to decide when to change their hedging strategy. Furthermore, we verify the volatile evolution of the estimated time-varying Bitcoin optimal hedge ratio, suggesting the need to further search for a better hedging instrument which achieves a less volatile time path to avoid excessive trading costs.",

With several improvements to predict PoW block proposal rewards and to maximize the extractable rewards of the same ones, the ultimate Ethereum's transition to PoS applied in the Paris Hard-Fork, more generally known as \"The Merge\", has meant a significant modification on the reward system in the platform.

        "abstract": "As the big data era has emerged, people are steadily discovering the value of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Traditional data trading schemes, however, have poor trustworthiness due to their vulnerability to self-caching, impermissible tampering, and single point of attack. Although blockchain-based data trading has decentralized, tamper-resistant, and traceable features, the participants cannot derive the device of generation from the data, so the data may be fake and forged from the beginning.  This paper proposes a verifiable hybrid blockchain-based data trading platform integrating Digital Twin. We used a public blockchain for data trading and a private blockchain for advertising and traceable evidence, storing details of Digital Twin from different periods. Data buyers can view the real-time digital twins stored on the blockchain to make purchase decisions and use them as evidence to determine the authenticity of the data purchased. The experiments evaluate the feasibility of the model and its performance on the blockchain.",

                "The paper explores an interesting application of digital twin (DT) technology to digitize and validate the data of IoT sellers, and improve the trustworthiness of such data for IoT data buyers in IoT data trading schemes. The idea, at a high level, is to use: (a) a public blockchain to broadcast buyer demands and execute related smart contracts, and (b) a private blockchain to store the DT specifications corresponding to seller's data-generating device(s). The DT can be used as evidence to adjudicate the authenticity of the seller's data, and also as advertisements to help purchasing decisions by buyers. A penalty mechanism is provided wherein the buyer can prosecute the seller by using a proof of the seller's DT. \n\nWhile the overall idea is interesting, the execution seems flawed and incomplete to me. To begin with, it is unclear how the verifying chain verifies the authenticity of the DT itself. Irrespective of whether the DT is generated off-chain and then stored on-chain by the seller, or if the DT is generated dynamically by the chain using the seller's data, I don't see a root of trust except for the seller, and it is unclear to me how the fundamental data authenticity issue is resolved. \n\nSecondly, the trust model is not very clear to me. Is the seller okay with putting potentially sensitive data on the blockchain? If yes, why can it not get the data authenticated by some trusted certifying authority, instead of creating the DT? Even if the DT was created, how does the network trust the DT without validating its authenticity? Is there an authenticated mechanism to create a DT for the seller's IoT device? If yes, then this merely shifts the root of trust from the seller to the entity generating the DT. Why is such an entity trusted? If there exists a globally trusted list of DT generators, how is this different from having a globally trusted list of certifiers certifying the seller's data?  \n\nI am also not sure how scalable the solution is, especially with the use of hybrid blockchains. It seems to me that the system would work well with many buyers and few sellers, but the paper does not seem to make this clear or validate the scalability of the solution via experiments. For now, the choices of public, private and hybrid blockchains seem somewhat arbitrary to me.  \n\nIt would be interesting to see what advantages this DT-based solution provides over and above the solution based on simple authentication of the seller's data by a trusted certifying authority.",

        "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have gained a lot of attention in recent years, mostly due to their decentralized manner of operation and their growth in value. However, a major drawback most of them possess is their high energy consumption. Current solutions to this problem have significant limitations: bringing back centralization and/or substituting the required energy with, e. g., storage space. This paper aims to address the problem by investigating the use of a two-level deep reinforcement learning (RL) model to design incentive policies for green mining in cryptocurrencies. This is done by modeling one such energy-intensive cryptocurrency system and creating an RL environment. Finally, by running simulations in an RL environment, we develop and test incentive policies, according to which cryptocurrency participants who primarily use renewable energy for their mining operations are more likely to add new blocks to the blockchain. Our results show that even when the green score of each crypto miner (determined by their use of green energy sources) has relatively small importance (up to 0.3) in their selection probability, miners still shift towards green mining in order to increase their chance of being picked to validate cryptocurrency transactions and receive the corresponding rewards.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains lie at the heart of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have shown great promise to revolutionize finance and commerce. Although they are gaining increasing popularity, they face technical challenges regarding scaling to support greater demand while maintaining their desirable security properties. In an exciting line of recent work, many researchers have proposed various scalable blockchain protocols demonstrating the potential to solve these challenges. However, many of these protocols come with the assumptions of honest majority and symmetric network access, which may not accurately reflect the real world, where the participants may be self-interested or rational. Secondly, these works show that their protocol works in an ideal environment where each party has equal access to the network, whereas different parties have varying latencies and network speeds. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature that explores game-theoretic attacks on these protocols.\n\nWe propose a scalable blockchain protocol, \\emph{Interlude}, which comes with the typical security guarantees while focusing on game-theoretic soundness and network fairness. The novelty of Interlude is that it has a relatively simple design consisting of a sequence of parallel blocks containing disjoint transaction sets that can be mined quickly, followed by a series block that is slow to mine and gives the honest parties in the network time to synchronize. Thus, between the chaos of parallel blocks, our blockchain protocol masquerades an interlude moment of harmony in a series block that synchronizes the network.",

While the explanation for occurrence and outperformance of momentum is unclear, momentum strategies are persistent over several asset classes and markets, which makes it reasonable to apply momentum in crypto markets as well. This paper exploits the momentum market anomaly by using momentum-based input features to train neural networks and gradient-boosted trees for the prediction of crypto asset price movements over 1 month (1M), 5 days (5D), 3 days (3D) and 1 day (1D) trading periods.

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel trust and reputation system for a decentralized blockchain-based marketplace with support for Smart Contracts. Specifically, we assume that a Smart Contract is associated with each transaction. At the completion of the transaction, the Smart Contract is responsible for providing automatic feedback on the transaction, replacing notoriously unreliable buyer feedback by a more objective assessment of how well the buyer and the seller have fulfilled their contractual obligations. This eliminates the complications inherent in identifying and filtering out untruthful buyer feedback. The proposed trust and reputation system is based on Laplace's Law of Succession where the trust engine predicts a seller's trust as the probability that she will fulfill her contractual obligations on the next transaction. Our second contribution is to illustrate three applications of the proposed blockchain-based trust and reputation model. First, we discuss an application to a multi-segment marketplace, where a malicious seller may establish a stellar reputation by selling cheap items, only to use their excellent reputation score to defraud buyers in a different market segment. Next, we demonstrate how our trust and reputation model works in the context of sellers with time-varying performance due, say, to overcoming an initial learning curve. We provide two discounting schemes wherein older reputation scores are given less weight than recent ones. Finally, we show how to predict trust and reputation scores far in the future, based on incomplete information. Extensive simulations have confirmed the accuracy of our analytical results.",

It is also unclear if the model is applied through a smart contract integrating buyer feedback and, if so, how false claims by the buyer can be taken into account.  \n\nDetailed comments:\nAt the very beginning the idea of a smart contract implementing more objective feedback than buyer\u2019s subject feedback is proposed, but then in the body of paper smart contracts are not mentioned. \n\nSimulation is used to carry out numerical analysis, but it is unclear if the model captures real-world behaviors. In a market place a variety of seller types are available and it is possible that initial beliefs of the buyers depend on the seller types (geographical location, big sellers vs small sellers, offered assurances, etc. ). \n\nIn the model k captures the number of times the seller fulfilled its obligations. It is unclear how to establish k in a decentralized manner, especially in presence of dishonest buyers. It would be interesting to pay further attention on how a buyer can provide its feedback and how the smart contract will process it to establish if obligations have been fulfilled or not. \n\nI'm not an expert of reputation models, but the related work is surprisingly light on the subject. Since the paper presents a theoretical model, not really blockchain-based, I suggest to enlarge the scope of the related work to reputation models in general, not necessarily connected to blockchains.",

The purpose of PoL is to use the wasted computing power in another field that is also consuming massive computing power, training large-scale deep learning models. The success of PoW is largely due to that its proof can be verified in constant time. In this paper, we propose a new method for replacing cryptopuzzles with large-scale model training based on the observation of the similarity between the gradient changes during model training and hash functions. Our new consensus mechanism can verify a proof in constant time. Experiments show that the performance of our proposed new consensus mechanism meets expectations.",

                "In this paper the authors present an interesting idea for a new consensus algorithm that attempts to limit the amount of energy that gets wasted by Proof of Work (PoW) and instead use it for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) computations that can help in training neural networks. Their method depends on the opacity of large neural networks, according to which, in order to compute the value of a weight at iteration i the actual execution of the the training algorithm from i-1 has to be made and no other faster shortcut exists. The authors essentially replace the hash computation of standard PoW with another similarly expensive computation that produces actual work by training a network. The proposed mechanism is able to achieve some necessary properties for creating large-scale blockchains and seems to outperform existing solutions with respect to the verification time of the Proof of Learning (PoL) proof.\n\nWhile their proposal is an interesting one, it raises some security concerns that they are not adequately addressed by the paper. While their approach is structurally similar to PoW, it depends on the opacity of large neural networks, a property that it is not as well studied as the the preimage resistance of PoW has been, with respect to the security guarantees it can offer. A related question is whether a procedure for determining which models are suitable for use with the proposed mechanism (i.e., are opaque enough) exists. A formal mathematical analysis of the proposed consensus mechanism (if possible) would greatly improve the confidence in it.\n\nRegarding Algorithm 2, is there the possibility of the randomly generated requirements R leading to a model W' with worst accuracy than W and therefore never passing the verification process and stalling the consensus process?\n\nIn Section III.A.e (page 3) the authors say that a successful spoofing reduces the fairness of the mechanism, but there is no clear definition of what it is meant by fairness.\n\nThe weights of the model as defined in Section IV.B (page 4) should have a different indexing variable (e.g., m), as otherwise it is implied that |W| = |D|, which is not necessarily true.\n\nThe experiments of the paper are adequate to support the claims of the paper, but it would be helpful if they were extended to include the mean and the standard deviation of the block interval for the cases considered in Figures 1, 3, and 4.\n\nRegarding Figure 2, there seems to be an inconsistency between the figure and the text: the text says that Recomputation techniques grow rapidly, when a single node has fixed power, but the figure title is \"Fixed Computing Power throughout Network\". Conversely, the text says that Performance Metrics techniques grow rapidly when there is fixed computing power throughout the network, but the figure title is the opposite.\n\nThe language of the paper suffers from occasional spelling and syntax errors, some of which are noted below:\n\n- is getting -> got (page 1, line 8, right)\n- needs to be -> need to be (page 2, line 11, left)\n- use*s* a confidence (page 2, line 19, left)\n- neutral network -> neural network (page 4, line 11, left)\n- statement is collect -> statement is correct (page 4, line 38, left)\n- As *it* can be seen (page 6, line 31, right)",
                "In Section II C, the authors say \". However, even if a PoL consensus mechanism does not protect privacy, it can also be used to train public pre-trained models, like [19], which will be beneficial to all.\" This reduces the applicability of the proposed solution because it can only be used for a specific set of learning operations and not for applications involving\u00a0privacy-sensitive\u00a0training.\u00a0\n\nThe PoL mechanism described hinges on the Requirement of Directed Guiding Gradients parameter (R).\u00a0Each miner should try to modify the weight parameters of the learning model until they satisfy the requirement for R.\u00a0How the R value is arrived at is not explained in Section IV (Proposed mechanism), it is instead left for the experimental section.\u00a0\n\n\nSince the miners randomly select different mini-batches for training using SGD, after a miner wins a given round by arriving at the right weights to satisfy R, is the computation and training done by the rest of the miners to generate their own individual weights wasted? Can their trained models/weight values be incorporated into the winning learning model/weights? Or do all losing miners discard the current weights and start the next computation with a new set of weights and the corresponding R value?\u00a0\u00a0Since all nodes in the network are running the same model, hence it is not\u00a0reducing replicated work among miners.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt seems like there need to be two levels of consensus, first consensus mechanism is for all miners to agree on which testset to use for verification since they need to use the same testset each time to verify the validity of the proof. And the next consensus mechanism about the validity of the proof. This does not seem scalable for large systems.\n\nThe current example assumes the same deep learning model being trained by the system of miners in perpetuity. It looks like there needs to be another consensus mechanism to decide which set of starting weights all nodes are going to use to generate the proof if the model needs to be changed.\u00a0\n\nThere is no clear threat model or formal analysis of the security guarantees of the proposed mechanism including any possible attacks to subvert the value of R.\n\n\nThe paper has some grammar errors that should be checked by the authors. Below is a non-exhaustive list of errors found in the paper.\nSection II A: is simply too slow due to repeating (the repetition of the) training process.\u00a0\nfederal learning\u00a0in place of\u00a0federated learning\u00a0in multiple places in the paper.\nSection III A:\u00a0Our objective is to design the (a) PoL mechanism that satisfying (satisfies) the following desirable properties\nSection III A:\u00a0computing power throughout (the) network.",
                "I like the direction of this work and would like to eventually see it published but at the current stage, the results appear somewhat preliminary.\n\nIs it feasible to reach 100 percent opacity of neural networks?\n\n\"Constant verification\"\nThe authors mean constant verification time. Constant with what? The authors themselves discuss an example when the verification time can vary.\n\n\"For modifying mini-batch, we fix the dataset so that miner can only select mini-batches from dataset, avoiding strategic falsification of data.\" Does it solve the problem? Perhaps it is possible to select mini-batches in a way that is beneficial to the miner?\n\nHow big is the space of input instances if the dataset is fixed? Too small of a dataset may lead to a violation of multiple properties."

The authors say that their work is based on blst library for BLS12-381 curve implementation but it is not clear to me if they take blst Pippenger as the baseline of section IV.\n- A good baseline could be any of the zprize implementations (https://github.com/z-prize/2022-entries/tree/main/open-division)\n- Does table II take into account the storage required throughout all the algorithm or just the initial storage of input points?\n- It would have been good to give concrete examples with B and M values in sections II.B and III.\n- At the end of II.A, the authors assume that it is straightforward to restrict a_{i,j} \\leq q/2. To do so it seems that one should write a_{i,j} in the set of {-2^{c-1},...,2^{c-1}-1}$ instead of {0,...,2^c-1}. It is indeed straightforward of the is a spare bit in the group order r (e.g. 255 bits instead of 256). But this point was not discussed.\n\n* minor remarks:\n- About the open question: the extra cost of GLV decomposition comes from the Babai rounding, which cost an inverse. A way to solve this was in (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565.pdf) by using some basis pre-computation and substituting the inverse by a right-shift. This increases the bound on sub-scalars by +1 but there are tricks to minimize this. Anyway, it should be very efficient for big multi-scalar multiplications.\n- in I.C page 4, G_2 is not exactly the order r subgroup of E(Fp_2) but it happens to be isomorphic to this subgroup using the curve sextic twist. But this is a minor detail with respect the paper scope.\n\n* Some typos: \n- p.1: ...lately becomes an essential... --> became\n- p.1: ...easily apply to... --> applied\n- p.2: where a_i's --> (only a_i in equation mode)\n- p.4: G2 is the the order r --> the order..",

                "The paper presents a new method for multi-exponentiation over groups (or equivalently, multi-scalar multiplication for elliptic-curve based instantiations of such groups) -- an operation that is commonly encountered in pairing-based zkSNARKs. The paper combines builds upon the well-known Pippenger's bucket method [9] (popularly used by many pairing-based zkSNARK implementations such as ZCash, TurboPLONK etc.) with recent improvements in the preprocessing-heavy but fast approach in due to LGF [12] to achieve faster computation than Pippenger's method while also reducing the amount of pre-computation in [12]. \n\nOn the positive side, the paper addresses an important question, and appears to be technically sound. From a theoretical standpoint, it is certainly an interesting contribution. However, it has two serious drawbacks. First of all, I did not see a clear motivation for switching from [12] to the proposed scheme. \n\n1. For typical zkSNARK applications (especially those related to blockchains, such as rollups), the main bottleneck today is throughput. I did not see a clear motivation for why investing in heavy pre-processing  to support faster transaction throughput should be replaced by a meet-in-the-middle solution. In fact, many zkSNARK protocols by themselves have heavy preprocessing to generate the CRS. A compelling use case for low pre-processing cost at the cost of lower throughput, which is what the current solution offers in comparison to [12], seems to be missing at the moment. \n\n2. The authors do nor compare their proposed method with [12] w.r.t. running time at all. The only comparison with [12] is w.r.t. pre-processing overhead, while the entire running time comparison is restricted to Pippenger's bucket method. Even if [12] turns out to be faster than the proposed method, a comparison should be presented to help the reader understand the tradeoffs between pre-processing overheads and running time more clearly. \n\nFinally, since the paper is being submitted to a blockchain venue, I was expecting to see at least one end-to-end implementation of zkSNARK protocol using the proposed method, and the impact on proof generation time. This was also missing. Currently, the paper reads like an exercise in elliptic curve crypto, with only a very remote connection to blockchains."

The Mining industry is among the leading industries that are incorporating blockchain technology in efforts to streamline the minerals supply chain and enhance digital mining. Among the key utilization of the technology is for enabling the traceability of minerals and precious stones which remain a critical bottleneck in the industry. In this paper, we review the literature, published in the past decade that discusses the usage of blockchain technology in the traceability of minerals and gemstones.  The results from the initial critical review indicate that while blockchain technology has great potential for use and acceptability in the traceability of minerals, its pitfalls pose critical unintended consequences including exclusion of the miners and manipulation by unscrupulous parties. It is therefore prudent to approach the blockchain technology application in the industry not blindly but have holistic research on the implications of the blockchain to its intended use.",

So, it may not even be visible to other participants that there is an adversary that controls majority of hashing capability.

        "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger managed by all participants. The full nodes which store the entire ledger play an essential role in managing it in a transparent and decentralised manner. However, it is difficult to verify that full nodes store the entire ledger in their dedicated storage due to Sybil, outsourcing, or generation attacks. Existing work on proving storage for cloud computing and remote data storage applications has high latency for decryption, and its impact on decentralisation is unclear, rendering it impractical for use in blockchain. In this paper, we propose a decentralised Practical Proof of Storage (PPoS) solution for blockchain full nodes with asymmetric latencies for encryption and decryption, which introduces a chained encryption and decryption architecture. To generate a unique replica of a block, each full node performs encryption with its own address and a previously encrypted block, storing the unique block in its dedicated storage. In PPoS, encryption is expensive and time consuming, enabling it to detect outsourcing and generation attacks and to deter Sybil attacks. Simultaneously, decryption is about 25 times faster than encryption, resulting in minimal performance overhead. The proof process is also decentralised by randomly selecting provers, verifiers, and encrypted blocks. Our experiments use up to 720 real BitCoin blocks to evaluate the performance and quantify the decentralisation of PPoS. Our results show that PPoS's asymmetric design reduces decryption time 25-fold over existing approaches, while maintaining a high degree  of decentralisation, confirming its suitability for blockchain full nodes.",

The mining time for one block approximately follows an exponential distribution; it has a high variable rate that one block time can't reflect the mining power. Consequently, conventional PoW blockchain uses a large number of  blocks to evaluate the mining power, leading to a long period of difficulty adjustment time that can't adapt to the fast-paced market. An innovative consensus algorithm called real-time block rate targeting(RTT) fixes there problems, showing lower variance block times and shorter difficulty adjustment periods.\n\n\nIn this paper, we show that RTT consensus algorithm makes chains more vulnerable to double spending attacks that attackers could make successful attacks at lower costs. We then introduce the PoWVDF protocol. It doesn't lower the double spending costs while retaining RTT's low variable block times and shorter difficulty adjustment periods.",

The attack idea is that the attacker attempts a double spend only if a new block has not been found for a while and so there is an high chance to find it soon. But how does that advantage the attacker with respect to the honest miners? Especially in avoiding the honest chain to outgrow the attacker private chain after the first block has been found? Beside saving resources (which are not computed in the paper), what advantage not mining for a certain time has for the attacker over honest miners? They are more likely to mine a new block as the attacker is. Finally, no consideration on the attack success is presented. The gain for a successful attack times its probability could be compared with the weighted cost of its failure to evaluate the attack effectiveness. As the attack is named \u201clow cost\u201d, a definition of a \u201ccost\u201d concept would have been appreciated.\n\n\u201c We have also performed experiments on conventional double-spend attacks and low-cost double-spend attacks on RTT and PoWVDF, and the experiments show that PoWVDF has better security against the double-spending attacks.\u201d\nThis claim does not find any ground in the paper.

Is it a simulation shortcoming effect?\n7) Regarding figures 3 and 4 what are the parameters used (e.g. Z and t_cut)? Are we reading it correctly that if t* = 0, so the attacker never waits and always tries to double spend they will succeed with a 50% probability if their q is 40% ? How can that be correct? By the way, q is never formally introduced, we assumed it is the relative computing power, is it correct? And relative to which chain in the set C?

That is a positive trait that needs to be pointed out. Other than that, I only have the following points for you to consider:\n1. Consider extending the acronym right at the beginning of section II - SaaS, indicating that it means Software-as-a-Service, since you end up using a few more times later in the text. It's always a good practice to explain acronyms in their first usage, especially if you use them multiple times afterwards.\n2. You should clarify the \"Upgradeability\" paragraph in section II.B, namely if you plan to create a single token type to be used interchangeably in your platform or if every asset has its own token type defined by the smart contract that regulates it. From the context of that paragraph, it seems that you're opting for the second one. If that is indeed the case, it needs to be clarified a bit better.\n3. When you present Fig. 2, you should also consider introducing the type of blockchain that you are planning to use. Later on, in section IV., it's possible to infer that you are considering a public blockchain. At this stage, I also agree that it's not necessary to specify which one, but you should at least mention that you're strongly considering using a public option.\n4. Expanding a bit on that last one, why aren't you considering a private or even consortium blockchain for your implementation? Especially since, in section V., you indicate the entities that can benefit from your solution (real estate developers, housing cooperatives, and real estate funds). These entities can set up their own blockchain solutions, using either an existing framework such as the HyperLedger family, or even commissioning a more proprietary solution that could go around consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, that essentially create the transactions costs issue that you mention in section IV.",

In particular, Ethereum is quickly approaching the 1\u00a0TB storage limit for a node what may significantly reduce the candidates able to run an Ethereum fullnode. In this paper, we propose a new synchronization and storage strategy for Ethereum that takes full advantage of the Distributed Hash Table implemented in all clients but left unused. By digging into the history of Ethereum's synchronization and storage strategies, we justify why such distribution of storage duties among peers makes much sense today. We implemented our solution in the official Ethereum client Geth and validated its smooth operation on a private Ethereum instance. Our solution can save around 60% of the storage of a node (360\u00a0GB) which represents a total of 12\u00a0PB of data at the network scale, while being fully backward compatible with current clients.",

        "abstract": "A significant portion of research on distributed ledgers has focused on circumventing the limitations of leader-based blockchains mainly in terms of scalability, decentralization and power consumption. Leaderless architectures based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) avoid many of these limitations altogether, but their increased flexibility and performance comes at the cost of increased design complexity, so their potential has remained largely unexplored. Management of write access to these ledgers presents a major challenge because ledger updates may be made in parallel, hence transactions cannot simply be serialised and prioritised according to token fees paid to validators. In this work, we propose an access control scheme for leaderless DAG-based ledgers which is based on consuming credits rather than paying fees in the base token.

Although a lot of work discusses the intersection of blockchain and ML, there is little clarity in mapping, understanding, and evaluating the various approaches in this space. This paper contributes to this new area by the following: (1) we introduce a taxonomy of ML on Chain. This taxonomy considers existing and future potential methods in this area and groups them based on their design characteristics. We consider in the taxonomy five off-chain approaches and a baseline on-chain approach. (2) we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of ML on Chain methods. We compare the different 5 groups of solutions across different settings and three ML model types: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors and neural networks.

For each suspicious transaction, FrontDef analyzes the bytecode of the contract the transaction attempts to interact and assembles a sequence of mimic transactions to replicate the attack strategy. FrontDef then uses the assembled transactions to frontrun the suspicious attack transaction to prevent financial loss. Empirical results show that FrontDef can successfully detect and assemble mimic transactions for all of the 24 benchmark cases that includes 21 historical attacks that occurred on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). They also confirm that FrontDef can process up to 1230 transactions per second, which currently is greater than the maximum throughput of Ethereum and BSC.",

We want to increase charity transparency by implementing a blockchain-based system, which will increase public trust in charity. The goal of the research paper is to create a decentralized fundraising platform where entrepreneurs can request funding for their business campaigns from sponsors. The platform will be supported by a web3-based authentication and supply chain (also implemented using blockchain). In contrast to other fundraising platforms, the money will be deposited directly into the account of the resource provider. By doing this, the money is allocated properly, preventing any misuse by the entrepreneur. A supply chain management system (also implemented using smart contracts or blockchain) is in charge of allocating the right resources to the entrepreneur. Here, smart contracts handle the fund's transactions and resource supply without the need for a third central party. The transactions would be impossible for hackers to alter with the aid of Blockchain. Business campaigners, resource providers, and donors will all require their own web3-based authentication. The Ethereum \nBlockchain network will be the only source of truth for each transaction's details in the event of any financial discrepancies. Like any other social media platform, for instance Reddit, the website will support transparency and allow all approvers to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the business campaign.

        "abstract": "The pseudo-anonymity offered by cryptocurrencies has always been a distinctive feature of decentralized payment technologies. However, in the last decade, a few techniques, such as address clustering and deanonymization, have undermined the effectiveness of the privacy provided by cryptocurrencies. \nThis paper investigates, for the first time, user account clustering in the Polkadot network, one of the most innovative account-based altcoins in the market. To achieve this goal, we levereged the \"deposit address reuse\" heuristic on the Polkadot relay chain. In detail, we propose a novel deposit address detection algorithm, combined with a general clustering methodology. To show the viability of the approach, we present a case study involving Binance and Kraken, the two major exchanges active in the Polkadot network. The analysis extends over a sensitive time window-starting from Polkadot genesis (May 2020) up to block 12,532,600 (October 2022). Thanks to the proposed methodology, we clustered more than 145,440 accounts belonging to exchanges, and more than 25,000 user accounts, representing around 25% of all the Binance/Kraken on-chain customers. In addition, we extracted several insights for the two considered crypto exchanges and their activities in the Polkadot network-for instance, the two different strategies used to handle on-chain customer transactions, or the unusually high transactions flow between the two cited exchanges.\nThe general applicability of our technique, the preliminary achieved results-showing both the viability and the value provided by our approach-, and the research hints discussed in the paper, also, pave the way for further research in the field.",

        "abstract": "Designed as a distributed data storage system, blockchain employs a consensus mechanism to validate the addition of new data block while saving the need for mediation by a centralized server. However, when the blockchain technology is applied in decision-making applications, the consensus mechanism requires the decision to be deterministic, which will ignore different recommendations made by multiple agents and may put the computing system at risk. In this paper, we propose and develop SMARPchain, a paradigm of reputational probabilistic blockchain which is based on smart markers. The distinguishing characteristic of our SMARPchain approach is that it enables multiway branching which allows differing agents to explore further according to their own configuration. If multiple probabilistic branches converge on their decisions some time later, they can be merged back to the same blockchain. SMARPchain satisfies three desirable requirements of recognizability, compatibility, and authenticability, and evaluation results show that SMARPchain will enhance the security and robustness of multi-agent decision making systems with acceptable overhead.",

        "abstract": "Renewable energy microgrids are flourishing due to the rising environmental consciousness. Blockchain technology is considered a promising solution for advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) connecting distributed microgrids, enabling power tracking and trading among participants. However, AMIs are vulnerable to attacks, particularly the Inflated Power Generation (IPG) attack, in which energy producers manipulate smart meters to report more energy than they actually produce. Currently, detecting IPG attacks relies mainly on human intervention, which is costly and time-consuming, making the process inefficient and not scalable. Although blockchain-based AMIs possess desired features, they are not immune to IPG attacks since there is no on-chain ground truth to assess the reasonability of the reported amount of energy produced. This study proposes a novel Gated Tri-Tower Transformer (GT3) neural network architecture for a multivariate time series classifier to serve as an IPG attack detector for each AMI blockchain node to validate energy transactions. The GT3 model captures temporal correlations and fuses different features to enhance the accuracy of IPG attack detection. Our experiments with the CAISO dataset demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms the most advanced detectors, with an increased detection rate from 71.8% to 80.5% and a reduced false alarm rate from 12.2% to 5.6%. Moreover, we investigated and concluded that GT3 performs better than prior works even during the ramp-up periods for as little as one month of collected data.",

        "title": "SecurShard: A Model for Hierarchical Fault Detection in Blockchain Sharding",
        "abstract": "Sharding increases concurrency in a blockchain system by splitting validators into groups (shards). Each shard processes a different transaction block such that throughput increases linearly in proportion to the number of shards. Contemporary sharding systems assume that shards are \u2018perfect'. Therefore, shards need to be formed in such a way that they have negligible probability of failure. However, there are several limitations. In reality, shards can be faulty (violates the \u2018perfect' shard assumption) and an invalid block validated by a faulty shard cannot be detected until the block is appended to the blockchain. Thus, there is no fault detection mechanism during transaction processing. In this paper, we present a hierarchical fault detection model called SecurShard. The SecurShard model proposes mechanisms of combining shards into groups, one-to-all mapping of a transaction block to all shards in a group, and 100% consensus requirement to validate and append a block to blockchain; all these to ensure that a potentially invalid block is detected with high probability during transaction processing rather than after appending to blockchain. Furthermore, the mapping scheme relaxes the constraint that all shards need to be \u2018perfect'. This also leads to the possible usage of smaller shards that are more performant than contemporary bigger shards while still maintaining the collective fault tolerance of the system. An elaborated theoretical analysis is presented which demonstrates the advantages of SecurShard in terms of fault tolerance and performance over traditional sharding systems.",

Blockchain use cases are now being explored by traditional, transaction-oriented businesses in the finance, insurance, logistics and healthcare sectors to name a few. This has expanded further with the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \n\nMassive amounts of data are generated by IoT devices and are recorded in the blockchain. While blockchain provides many advantages, such as immutability and transparency, its serialized nature makes impossible to read in a single query. Multiple requests are required even for simple tasks, such as displaying an account's transaction history. This further leads to the difficulty in understanding the data in the blockchain. In this paper, we address the problem of smart contract visualization in a real-time manner. To this end, we design a visualization dashboard for smart contracts. \n\nA visual aid for massive amounts of data helps users understand the blockchain's overall activities, uncover operational risks and provide critical intelligence by visualising unusual activities and connections. Such insights may enable the user to investigate and predict any anomalies or reveal any network vulnerabilities. Cattle farm selected as a use case because the voluminous data can be acquired from IoT sensors on the farm cattle.

        "abstract": "Nowadays blockchain systems are widely used in many different fields, not only as a kind of payment method, i.e. cryptocurrency, but also as the infrastructure of decentralized applications. A smart contract, which is a program running on the blockchain, e.g. Ethereum, enables decentralized applications without the need for any trusted third party. To deploy a smart contract every miner of the blockchain needs to perform the same function of the smart contract such that they reach a consensus on its final state. Therefore, current blockchain systems are deterministic and non-probabilistic, disallowing any randomness in smart contracts, which is a significant limitation for the applicability of blockchains. A wide range of real-world applications depend on random functions, most obvious examples are games and lottery applications. Various methods have been proposed To address the random number generation problem, such as using a trusted oracle or the block hash. All of those have different disadvantages and advantages. Noticing the lack of concrete guidance for the inclusion of randomness in smart contracts on blockchains, we investigate the state-of-the-art random number generation methods and compare them in several critical aspects including availability, unpredictability, unbiasability, verifiability, scalability, execution time and cost.",

In particular, to address the challenges posed by the growing blockchain state, M\u00f6bius enables its participants to verify all transactions while only storing a partial state. Unlike previous state sharding systems, the proposed protocol uses a novel vector commitment data structure to reduce the network bandwidth overhead via proof aggregation. Further, it utilizes a novel epoch-based multi-phase commitment technique for guaranteeing atomicity in cross-shard transactions. Experiments presented here show that M\u00f6bius reduces the disk requirement of each participant linearly with respect to the number of shards. Further, it presents a 4.7-7.3\u00d7 lower network bandwidth overhead when compared to existing state-of-the-art state sharding systems.

        "abstract": "The primary strengths of blockchain systems come from strong guarantees of immutability and reliability, and these systems can be extended with programmatic logic through Smart Contracts. Many such programmatic use cases would benefit from the use of external data. However, the method of bringing that data onto the blockchain needs to be trustworthy and secure. Otherwise, the benefits of blockchain, namely distributed trust, no single points of failure, and immutability, would be at risk. Blockchain oracles are proposed as a conceptual solution to this problem. A blockchain oracle acts as a trusted intermediary to external data. In this work we analyze existing proposals for Discernible event oracle mechanisms, which seek to address oracle queries with a broad knowledgeable answering population, to characterize problems related to the incentives imposed by external value that depends on oracle outcomes. In doing so, we focus on continued challenges to voting based oracles, including trust limitations and the need to match questions to knowledgeable answering parties. To address these difficulties, we propose an extension to existing oracle protocols to utilize reputation as a tool to measure value and as a tool to associate questions with context. By providing a method to track contextual knowledge, our proposal allows for context-based query matching and enables higher probability of correctness for a given population size as well as stronger participation incentives.",

Might the context concept also capture other aspects of variability of prevalence of external value-seeking in different domains?\n\nIf it is meant to be multi-domain reputation of individual entities, I think the current model seems to not allow reputation from one domain to affect reputation in another?

The things roam among the spaces and engage in computing with other things and spaces. The primary objective of our cryptocurrency is to provide an open-membership mechanism that supports a trust-less way of managing the actions of the things and spaces. With roaming things one of the important parameters to validate is the locations because the actions a thing can perform (i.e., the type of action and the target of the action) depends on the location of the thing. Another parameter to validate is the dimensions of spaces which in turn determine the validity of the actions things perform in the spaces. For example, a claim by a parking space that certain autonomous cars were parked there for a certain duration would have to be supported by the observed locations of the cars and observed sizes and locations of the parking spaces by other things roaming in the same area.

        "title": "An Automated Policy Verification and Enforcement Framework for Ethereum Applications",
        "abstract": "In recent years, with the support of appropriate smart contract-based access control policies, blockchain technology has proven to be a compelling solution for providing a unified, trusted platform for resource sharing. However, due to the immutability property of blockchain, it can be challenging to patch or fix bugs after the deployment of a smart contract. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the smart contract access control policies adhere to all specifications prior to their deployment, and the presence of anomalies within policies is not desirable. Thus, this paper proposes an automated policy verification and enforcement framework for Ethereum decentralized applications, which supports an automated off-chain policy verification before its deployment to the underlying blockchain. We integrate a verification engine within the off-chain module paired with a translator to convert XACML policies into Solidity smart contracts and vice-versa. Additionally, the experiments performed on benchmark XACML policies further reinforce the pragmatism of our proposal.",

        "abstract": "To prevent DoS attacks, Ethereum assigns a fixed gas cost to every atomic operation in the EVM and the party who creates a transaction has to pay for its overall gas usage. While the gas model is successful in preventing DoS attacks, it causes significant costs in transaction fees. For example, in June-September 2022, the average daily gas usage of Ethereum was almost four million dollars. We propose a solution to minimize these fees by moving most of the execution of a contract off-chain and storing only the bare minimum on-chain. We then trigger an on-chain execution only if there is a disagreement between the parties to the contract, which is in turn only possible if at least one party is acting dishonestly. In such cases, our approach can identify and penalize the dishonest party by making them pay not only for the gas usage of their own function calls, but also calls made by other parties. Thus, it is game-theoretically irrational to behave dishonestly in this protocol. If all parties are rational, the total gas usage goes down significantly. Notably, our approach does not require a sidechain and works directly on the main Ethereum blockchain. We also provide extensive experiments over real-world Ethereum smart contracts, demonstrating that our protocol reduces their gas usage by 40.09%.",

The amount of gas needed and the prices around the gas units restrict the functionality of smart contracts. Hence, a new protocol is proposed in this work to move part of the execution process of smart contracts off-chain and reduce the overhead of execution costs on all the nodes. The protocol involves multiple steps and many roles. There is a need to modify the original contract into a specified way so that it works as per the protocol rules. \n\nAlthough, the modifications required to create the contract W out of the original contract C to work with this protocol are straight forward for contracts involving multiple calls to external calls this wouldn't be easy. Since this is a manual activity it would again add additional overhead for the developers. They not only need to understand the semantics around EVM but also the proper modifications needed for the protocol. The authors should have designed an automated way for this to be done and also, have a standard specification for the modification process. \n\nReferences start from [2] in introduction. The first reference was never used. This will have to be omitted if unused. Contributions should be itemized and listed as it is not clear from the current statement. There is no reference to the source code for the protocol anywhere in the paper. The Figures are all over the paper. They should be organized in such a way that they are in place around the place they are referred.\n\nThe protocol doesn't not include all the nodes on the network in the blockchain. How does this have the same guarantees as the smart contracts on blockchain? Its in the end very similar to how some of the side chains and rollups would work. This would make it a non-innovative idea. Either provide a detailed comparison with the side chains and rollups or make the process automated in order for this to be easily used. \n\nThe other issue with this work is the experimental results. They don't cover a simulation of multiple parties being involved. It needs to be experimentally tested and proved that the guarantees are better when used in this scenario and how the auctions help. Also, this protocol will same issues as the lightning network where the funds are to be locked or any similar protocols. Another aspect missing is if the protocol is too complicated for ERC 20 and ERC 721 what kind of applications is this protocol used for? May be a table to discuss various applications that could use this protocol. Multiple parties can collude in this protocol to benefit even if they are dishonest. What happens in this protocol if there are multiple dishonest parties? Simulation process for auctions is not at all clear.

While this is malicious behavior, several other cases should also be considered such as the results of the computations going wrong and the parties not having enough resources to execute a specific function call in the smart contract. \n4.\tThe idea presented in the paper uses replicated computation of the function calls across the parties involved.

The emergence of blockchain technology has inspired a new type of information exchange infrastructure on a peer-to-peer model that makes possible a set of use cases in sectors where improved efficiency, reliability, security and costs around transparency are intended. The public sector is mainly characterized by administrative processes that involve several institutions. If blockchain can promote various types of integration in an organization, the implications around its applicability and its interoperability in the complex integration of an inter-organizational public process remain to be demonstrated. \nIn this paper, we investigate a real-life use case in public administration related to the vehicle registration process involving multiple institutions to develop an architecture that makes possible a blockchain-based digitalization of the inter-organizational process. \nWe describe a case study and use it to extract the system requirements, analyze an approach that identifies coordination and data interoperability in public sector inter-organizational processes, and propose an architecture focused on transparency and privacy for effective deployment.

        "abstract": "In recent years, online marketplaces have seen a large increase in business. Managing and making sellers' reputations available to buyers is vital for the success of these markets since buyers may be dealing with unknown online sellers. Typically, prospective buyers assess sellers' performance by looking at past buyers' reviews, prior to making a purchase. In current online marketplaces, buyers' reviews are associated with their identities, raising privacy issues. Several decentralized solutions have been proposed using blockchain technologies to solve this problem. However, some of these systems are not entirely decentralized or have some weaknesses such as requiring a trusted third party. In this paper, we propose a system for decentralized reviewing that trades off cost for unlinkability. Using blockchain-based smart contracts, we propose a fully decentralized marketplace to provide reviewers with a secure and trusted platform. Here, buyers can use one-time identities to provide feedback on their transactions. The system also ensures that a review can only be submitted after a transaction is completed, and that at most one review may be submitted per transaction. The system enforces these properties through blockchain technologies and smart contracts. In addition, we propose an innovative approach to encourage buyers to submit reviews. The system has been prototyped using Remix IDE.",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks underlie a variety of decentralized paradigms including blockchains, distributed file storage and decentralized domain name systems. A central primitive in P2P networks is the peer selection algorithm, which decides how a node should select a fixed number of neighbors to connect with. In this paper, we consider the design of a peer-selection algorithm for unstructured P2P networks with the goal of minimizing the broadcast latency. We propose Goldfish, a novel solution that dynamically decides the neighbor set by exploiting the past experiences as well as exploring new neighbors. The key technical contributions come from bringing ideas of matrix completion for estimating message delivery times for every possible message for every peer ever connected, and a streaming algorithm to efficiently perform the estimation while achieving good performance. The matrix completion interpolates the delivery times to all virtual connections in order to select the best combination of neighbors. Goldfish employs a streaming algorithm that only uses a short recent memory to finish matrix interpolation. When the number of publishing source is equal to a node's maximal number of connections, Goldfish found the global optimal solution with 92.7% probability by exploring every node only once. In more complex situations where nodes are publishing based on exponential distribution and adjusting connection in real time, we compare Goldfish with a baseline peer selection system, Perigee [1], and show Goldfish saves approximately 14.5% less time under real world geolocation and propagation latency.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world applications employ web service frameworks to provide application programming interface (API) services to businesses and end-consumers, following a client-server architecture. Service providers typically run a web server to deliver services to consumers. Here, service providers and consumers often belong to different organisations in applications such as supply chain management and logistics. In multi-stakeholder safety-critical and mission-critical applications, the centralised web server delivers services by executing computations upon receiving consumers' API requests. Such computations may fail due to crash or byzantine failures. The former happens because of hardware or infrastructure faults, while the latter happens because of a malicious actor. Note that the organisation that runs the web server may act dishonestly by running computations incorrectly for financial benefits, or an external attacker may compromise the web server without the knowledge of the infrastructure owner. As a result of these failures, the centralised web server is susceptible to single-point-of-failure issues. The organisation that runs the web server must be blindly trusted and does not provide transparency and auditability to its clients. We propose DeWS, a Decentralised and Byzantine Fault-tolerant Web Service framework, which overcomes these single-point-of-failure issues while delivering transparency and auditability through a blockchain-based ledger. The proof-of-concept implementation of DeWS using the Tendermint blockchain platform shows that our framework can tolerate byzantine failures at the cost of high latency. DeWS is the first Byzantine Fault-tolerant web service framework. It can support a shift towards more decentralised web services to provide safety assurances for safety-critical and mission-critical applications.",

Implementation of cross-enterprise business processes in a distributed system is complex. Due to the globalization of businesses, there is a greater demand for business platforms that provide both information security and privacy. In these processes, technological advancements are extensively leveraging automation and simplification. However, most of enterprise systems are still centralized and work in silos. The advent of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and Smart Contracts are addressing some security and privacy challenges. However, these systems do not provide a perfect balance between end-to-end and cross-enterprise visibility and security of data. A further challenge is that the consensus/agreement provided by these systems cannot accommodate wider application requirements. As the business platforms currently provide agreement at the level of individual messages without considering the context of the business workflow. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework which provides flexible mechanism for application developers to define consensus parameters. In addition, the paper defines the notion of Design-Centric Consensus  (DCC) and information flow security inspired by the literature on information flow models and security protocols. It also identifies the need for multiple levels of consensus based on the application requirements. An architectural framework is also proposed that provides application-specific consensus while maintaining DCC and visibility.",

                "It's tough to follow the motivation of the paper and the reasoning behind the idea of creating a design-centric consensus framework, for instance, the author claims there are following gaps:\n\n1. Reconciliation of transaction data.\n2. Participants do not have complete end-to-end knowledge of a business transaction\n3. The application and chaincode developer is accountable for implementing security requirements\n\nHowever, no claims or references support those claims. For instance, in Hyperledger Fabric, there is no problem with the reconciliation of the transaction data; there, in fact, are several processes responsible for reconciling the data between participants in Hyperledger Fabric. In addition, the reconciliation of private data is achieved by utilizing the gossip protocol reliable to provide scalable communication middleware. The same is not entirely correct for the claim about the participants sharing end-to-end knowledge since the data is shared between participants except for probably with private data designed to be exclusively shared between a permitted set of participants. While the third point about security being implemented by application and chaincode developers is correct, the paper doesn't provide any construction to solve or address it. Hence not clear why it was mentioned here.  \n\nOverall I found the article's content too general and vague, lacking precise details explaining the architecture, design, security model, and properties. It would also be beneficial to provide a table to compare the existing platform and summarize the design choices showcasing the improvements.   \n\nI think significant refactoring must be done to the paper's content and improve the technical part and evaluation. Therefore I would cast my vote now strongly reject, but do encourage resubmission next year after the improvements are completed.",

It is not clear. \n-probability-based algorithms could have a citation. \n-Table 1 is not readable because the reader does not know all the abbreviations in one read. Consider replacing the abbreviation by the full expression. \n-I would put the contributions before the running example. \n-The authors should explain, even briefly, how Fabric works. \n-The contributions are not clear. What is a \"blockchain framework\"? Are the authors designing a new blockchain? What is \"DesignCentric Consensus\"?\n-The notion of Design Centric Consensus should also bring a detailed example. (For example, an Archimate model of a system implemeting the design centric consensus) or BPMN models of processes that together implement such a system. Without this, I believe the proposal is not strong enough. \n-The notion of cross-border information sharing also relates to blockchain interoperability. I encourage the authors to search the literature for techniques that implement consensus of information across blockchain systems. This area includes the four types of consensus that the paper exposes. \n-is it relevant for the reader to know how are the business processes created behind the scenes?

The essential one is the lack of a prototype implementation or a use case that enables the validation and evaluation of the proposed solution. Since end-to-end security is one of the main advantages of the proposed solution, a security analysis and assessment should be provided to compare the security level with the security level of other approaches.\n\nOther issues: The current structure of the paper does not allow us to follow the explanations with a common thread; this structure should be worked on to identify the contributions made and the relationships between them. Figures, in general, are not readable due to their size and to their font size. Some typos and grammatical mistakes should be fixed, even in the Abstract. Authors should check the language.

Based on blockchain technologies, cryptocurrency systems disperse the traditional centralized authority, which naturally requires the transaction history is able to be obtained and verified by all the participants, thus challenging users' privacy and anonymity. The lightweight client is the tool to use cryptocurrency systems for resource-constrained device owners. Despite many previous works that have analyzed anonymity issues in cryptocurrency and there are many industrial practices and academic efforts of lightweight clients, there is still a lack of comprehensive anonymity analysis for lightweight clients in cryptocurrency systems.\n\nThis article provides a systematization work of the anonymity issues of cryptocurrency lightweight clients and proposes the personal information vector to characterize the degrees of de-anonymizing users.

The architecture of the Hyperledger Fabric introduces a new architecture paradigm of simulate-order-validate and pluggable architecture, allowing a greater level of customization where one of the critical components is the world state database, which is responsible for capturing the snapshot of the blockchain application state. Hyperledger Fabric manages the state with the key-value database abstraction and peer updates it after transactions have been validated and read from the state during simulation. Therefore, providing good performance during reading and writing impacts the system's overall performance. Currently, Hyperledger Fabric supports two different implementations of the state database. One is LevelDB, the embedded DB based on \nLSM trees and CouchDB. In this study, we would like to focus on searching and exploring the alternative implementation of a state database and analyze whenever there are better and more scalable options. We evaluated different databases to be plugged into Hyperledger Fabric, such as RocksDB, Boltdb, and BadgerDB.

        "abstract": "Set reconciliation is an elementary problem in distributed systems, where the goal is to synchronize two sets with minimal communication costs. Over the years, several efficient solutions have been proposed, benefiting communication cost that is proportional to the set difference. They often rely on representations of the sets using  probabilistic data structures and coding theory. Typically, such methods have an underlying assumption of symmetry over the elements in terms of their chances to appear in the sets. We observe that in some applications of the set reconciliation problem, including major applications in the scope of blockchain, prior knowledge about the sets is sometimes available. Accordingly, we study the set reconciliation problem with a-priori information of elements regarding their inclusion in the two sets. We study the main approaches for set reconciliation and compare their potential to take advantage of this information to reduce their communication overhead. We rely on blockchain data from the Ethereum network to support our findings and evaluate in practice the potential savings.",

There are some definitions in equations that are missing or not defined before the equation, hence it's very hard to follow. In general, the entire flow of the paper requires some improvement, there are statements like:\n\n\"Any reconciliation protocol that requires an upper bound on \u03b4 can benefit from this estimation, as it saves the communication and latency costs of the preliminary protocol.\"\n\nor \n\n\"It can be shown that in this case, splitting the workload into two IBFs can increase the overall sucess rate\"\n\n or \n\n\"In reconciliation without prior context, the best we can do is to partition SA into k near-equal sets SA,i, e.g. using a hash function, and use k instances Ai to reconcile the subsets.\"\n\nrequires proper formulation or reference to the prior work. I think it has to be formulated with a more rigorous and cosine set of theorems or lemmas.\n\nIn addition, I think it could be beneficial to have some simulation or evaluation results to outline the outcome and the results.

If so, how does this accurately represent a blockchain, where this group is variable?\n\n-Please separate the proposed model from the related work. If the model is not the proposal of the paper, include it in the background. \n-\"Our main contribution is in presenting the set reconciliation prob- lem with prior information on the membership probability of elements. Likewise, we analyzed Ethereum nodes for the exploitation of prior knowledge. We suggest a method to improve the scalability of existing protocols for set reconciliation, and further enhance their success probability by utilizing prior information.\"- seems to me that the contribution is the method to improve the scalability rather than the presentation of the problem, as it is not a new problem.\n\n-How is the simulation in Figure 3 done?\n\n-Could Section III E be complemented with the methods blockchains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, others use for reconciliation? The related work should also explain the differences between Section IV and the existing solutions",

The applicability to the blockchain is relevant and supported by the referenced literature. \nSection II in particular provides good support to the employment of the proposed techniques. Even if I don't understand why fig 1 does not illustrate cumulative distribution function (CDF) that would better fit in supporting your arguments. \nThe section IIIB focuses on IBF-based and CPI reconciliation methods. Why? It would be nice to support this choice in view of section III E where Existing Solutions for the Blockchain Applications are described. However, these methods allow you to well support section IIIF on the estimation of \\delta.\nUnfortunately, section IV is  very simple and in particular section IVB that would be the key contribution of your paper is quite an exercise. The real contribution here would be to prove through realistic experiments that you can indeed achieve those benefits and you can estimate somehow p_e or at least provide a better estimator of \\delta.

This paper presents a SSI management system which was designed and implemented for police or firefighters who still manage identity information centrally. Furthermore, given the inherent risks associated with these occupations, it is imperative to have a secure healthcare system to meet their specific needs.

Although, little research has been done on Polkadot, I am sure there is some similar work on Ethereum or other technologies related to centralization that the authors could compare to or mention shortly.\n- The fact that Polkadot acts as a relay between multiple blockchains makes it very interesting.

While this issue has long been regulated in mature markets, in unregulated markets, such as crypto exchanges, this plague is very present, and even exacerbated by the low capitalizaton of many cryptocurrencies \nthat represent the perfect target for such a fraudulent scheme.\nIn this paper, we detail a Low Latency Detection solution (LLD) based on deep learning to automatically detect pump and dump activities on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. We train a LSTM-based auto-encoder on BTC valuations, which can reliably be considered a proxy for regular trading---due to their larger capitalization. We use this auto-encoder to predict valuations on alt coins and use thresholding on a Gaussian tail condition to trigger detection. \nWe argue that low  latency detection is paramount for the practicality of such approaches. Unlike previous methods, our solution (LLD) detects the majority of pumps in less than five minutes (2.2 minutes on average) when using OHLCV data at one-minute resolution. In addition, we use social media data only to generate ground truths during testing. We show that in many cases a significant amount of the trade volume could have been saved had LLD been used to trigger trade suspension mechanisms.\nThe idiosyncratic approach of our scheme, its sound rationale and viability, combined with the quality of achieved  results-tested over an extensive experimental campaign-and the insights discussed in the paper also pave the way for further research in the field.",

However, credential holders must update their verification proof, or witness whenever a credential is revoked in the system. The witness update is expensive and not feasible for applications with limited computational power, such as mobile phones. We propose a credential revocation management framework that removes the need for witness updates, while still utilising the benefits of the cryptographic accumulator. We use three accumulators, the notion of epoch and replication of accumulator transition from one state to another for verification. The evaluation shows our method is efficient and suitable for credential holders with limited computing resources.",

The use of cryptographic accumulators is a novel approach that brings efficiency to the verification process.

From table II it appears as the authors proposal greatly outperforms the alternative, but it should be noted that all revocations cost the same in approach A, while once per each epoch, a single revocation would cost more than 40 times the value in the table. This means that a single unlucky revocation would carry a much higher burden.\nVerification cost is similarly misleading. It is true that an epoch may contain many revocations, but with times as fast as the ones shown, i.e. \u201cat the end of each epoch, which takes approximately 558ms\u201d, having a verification cost dependent on the number of epochs passed may add up quickly. Moreover, this cost can only increase over time, and much faster than the milliseconds shown in fig 4, especially considering that it depends on the global number of revocations.\nOverall, in terms of performances, the proposal appears worst than the alternative in most cases.",
                "Efficient revocation in self-sovereign identity and anonymous credentials is an open problem. The use of Bloom filters maybe is useful, however, they should be implemented in a way that a user can prove non revocation without revealing who they are.\n \nAdditionally, claiming that the privacy of credentials is preserved because of the mapping to a prime number is not really true. The verifier can still link two verifications initiated by the same user. Along the same lines,  the authors do not address how the verifier will check a credential if they do not access it in the clear. Verification without accessing the credentials would require the generation and verification of zero-knowledge proofs."

        "abstract": "6G-enabled IoT demands effectively utilising scarce resources to provide massive scale in network capacity. While blockchain-based resource sharing schemes have been proposed to enable effective resource allocation, they alone cannot ascertain the trust in the participating nodes, as they do not monitor node activities during the resource sharing. Trust and Reputation Management (TRM) can potentially solve these trust issues. However, changeable keys employed in blockchains to improve privacy preservation may render the TRM unusable, as the same node is no longer identifiable by a single key to which the trust and reputation scores are bound. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving TRM for blockchain-based resource sharing in 6G-enabled IoT networks. Our solution employs interconnected public-private blockchains, namely Isolated Identity Chain and Main Resource-sharing Chain to protect nodes' identity. Our TRM framework allows the nodes to use changeable keys in each transaction, making it impossible to trace the sharing history. The experimental results on a proof-of-concept implementation indicate the feasibility of our framework as it only incurs minimal overheads.",

Each UTXO can only be used as an input in a transaction once, and using it in two or more different transactions is referred to as a double-spending attack. Ultimately, due to the characteristics of the Bitcoin protocol, double-spending is impossible.

But there should be a high level explaination of what you are mining, what fields, which data, how frequently, what are their significances and how will it help in the analysis. Without the aim and goal and implementation agnostic description of the system, the implementation section details become useless. Instead of puttin code blocks python, two liners algorithms would have been enoug for iteration through pools and swap events. \n\n\"wecollectedeventsfromaround3.7millionswapevents.\" this statement should have come in the introduction section to engage the reader.\n\nAnalysis lacks detail. Yes traces of arbitration are found which is interesting. But a more systematic approach is required for the analysis. How do you define the MEV approaches? A graph based model and algorithm can be decided it seems.\n\nI thank the authors for providing a detailed rebuttal.\nI agree that the paper is about how we identify instances of cross domain MEV. The method of data gathering is an important contribution of this paper. I believe a focused and systematic analysis of the proposed approach would make this manuscript a good full paper. But at this stage I recommend a poster."

The methods proposed over time have generated great insights into the deanonymization of the Bitcoin user base through the clustering of inputs and outputs. With advanced techniques being deployed by Bitcoin users, these heuristics are now being challenged in their ability to aid in the detection of illicit activity. In this SoK, we provide a comprehensive list of methods deployed by malicious actors on the network and illicit transaction mining methods. We highlight the issues associated with conducting law enforcement investigations and propose recommendations for the research community to address these issues. Our recommendations include the release of public data by exchanges to allow researchers and law enforcement to further protect the network from malicious users. We recommend the enhancement of current heuristics through machine learning methods and discuss how researchers can take the fight head-on against expert cyber criminals.",

        "abstract": "Plagiarism is stealing another person's work and projecting it as one's work. Here, work includes but is not limited to academic, legal, or business documents and software code. Similarity computation between documents plays a critical role in any plagiarism detection system. Rich set of prior work exists on the similarity computation of plain text documents. But, there is limited work on the similarity computation of documents with encrypted content. Encrypted document similarity is detected using techniques like secure multiparty computation. However, such a technique requires the document owners to be available online and the document owners need to manage the keys used for document encryption. In this paper we propose a blockchain-based plagiarism detection system that eliminates these limitations. Our system uses symmetric keys derived from the document content to carry out document encryption and smart contracts to compute the similarity of encrypted documents non-interactively. Moreover, we consider three popular similarity computation methods for plain text documents (bag-of-words, fingerprinting, and citation-based detection) and propose equivalent methods for similarity computation on encrypted documents.",

Additionally, the paper suggests a non-interactive one-time transformation of plaintext documents by the document owners before uploading the encrypted documents to the blockchain ledger, which eliminates the need for cryptographic key exchange between document owners. Furthermore, the proposed system supports multiple document similarity computation methods and various use cases, such as insurance fraud detection and secure blockchain-based document store."

With the huge popularity of NFT, the launch of new NFTs attracted many people to mint NFTs. However, because Ethereum has low processing speed and then cannot accommodate the explosive demands, it causes Crypto Gas War, which increases the overall transaction fee and wastes unnecessary gas. In this work, we propose a Raffle-based NFT launch to solve the Crypto Gas War. We demonstrated that our proposed NFT launch solves this problem but other existing solutions do not solve the problem. Moreover, our NFT smart contract is gas-efficient.

        "abstract": "The liquidity of the exchange is the most important factor when crytocurrency traders choose an exchange. However, the amount of liquidity provided by the liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges is insufficient when compared to centralized exchanges. This is because the liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges suffer from the risk of divergence loss inherent to the automated market making system. To this end, we introduce a new concept called margin liquidity and leverage this concept to propose a highly profitable margin liquidity-providing position. Then, we extend this margin liquidity-providing position to a virtual margin liquidity-providing position to alleviate the risk of divergence loss for the liquidity providers and encourage them to provide more liquidity to the pool. We show that our proposed margin liquidity is 8K times more capital efficient than the concentrated liquidity proposed in Uniswap V3.",

However, the lack of interoperability between blockchain networks and platforms is a significant challenge that leads to data and information silos. To address this challenge, a Blockchain Agnostic Interoperability Framework (BAILIF) is proposed, which provides a decentralized notary service and a cross-chain attestation and verification protocol. BAILIF adheres to the core principles of blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, and trust, and can be adopted in other decentralized ecosystems where blockchain interoperability is required. A proof of concept for a distributed energy trading application demonstrates the solution's feasibility. The results showed that BAILIF could achieve a throughput of up to 666 transactions per second, indicating its potential to enable seamless data sharing across blockchain platforms and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources.",

However, as in traditional markets, information asymmetry and market inefficiencies are used to the detriment of ordinary users via trading strategies that exploit \"Miner Extractable Value\" (MEV). We propose two extensions of Ethereum, one for proof of work (PoW), and one for proof of stake (PoS), that eliminate most forms of MEV by randomizing the execution order of transactions and hiding the content of transactions until their inclusion in a block.

The developers achieved anonymity, more specifically pseudonymity, by assigning an address with a specified format and revealing no clue about its owner. Although the transaction history of an address cannot expose the actual user behind the address, it can disclose hints about the behavioral role of the user. These behavioral roles could belong to a centralized exchange, cyber-security service, darknet market, gambler, mining pool, peer-to-peer financial service, or tumbler.\nIn this paper, we intend to classify a variety of Bitcoin addresses belonging to the stated wallet types. First, we gathered addresses and their types from wallet explorer websites and address clustering methods. Then, we extracted features from the existing transaction history of an address collected from a live full-node peer. Later, we inserted the bulk of data in a PostgreSQL database management system to retrieve data efficiently. We scripted queries to calculate primary features from the database. Furthermore, we added secondary features derived from primary ones. At last, we applied different models, such as decision tree, random forest, KNN, and XGBoost, to our training and test sets. Our results show that the best model for evaluative metrics was XGBoost, with a weighted average f1-score of 98.7%.",

        "abstract": "Tokenization and blockchain technology might significantly improve the energy industry by making electricity production, transmission, and consumption more open, safe, and effective. Tokenization enables the establishment of digital assets that reflect ownership or access to energy resources and enables blockchain to trace the origin and flow of energy produced. By incorporating these elements, we can build a more distributed and egalitarian energy infrastructure and make it easier to use renewable energy. However, legal barriers, integration with current systems, and scalability remain obstacles to the widespread use of these technologies in the energy industry. Therefore, there is a need for more study and development before the energy industry can ultimately reap the benefits of blockchain and tokenization. Accordingly, in this work, we suggest a systematization of knowledge to capture recent development and summarize research in the blockchain domain and its application to the energy sector.",

        "abstract": "Mining in proof-of-work blockchains has become an expensive affair requiring specialized hardware capable of executing several megahashes per second at huge electricity costs.  Miners earn a reward each time they mine a block within the longest chain, which helps offset their mining costs.  It is therefore of interest to miners to maximize the number of mined blocks in the blockchain and increase revenue.  A key factor affecting mining rewards earned is the connectivity between miners in the peer-to-peer network.  To maximize rewards a miner must choose its network  connections carefully, ensuring existence of paths to other miners that are on average of a lower latency compared to paths between other miners.  We formulate the problem of deciding whom to connect to for miners as a combinatorial bandit problem.  Each node picks its neighbors strategically to minimize the latency to reach 90% of the hash power of the network relative to the 90-th percentile latency from other nodes.\nA key contribution of our work is the use of a network coordinates based model for learning the network structure within the bandit algorithm. \nExperimentally we show our proposed algorithm outperforming or matching baselines on diverse network settings.",

It analyzes the impact of block propagation latency, the speed at which a mined block is spread throughout the network, on the rewards earned by the miners. The authors show that the relationship between propagation latency and rewards is more complex than previously thought, as a miner's rewards depend not only on its own connectivity to the network but also on the connections between other miners. The paper proposes a decentralized policy called Cobalt to optimize rewards and balance the trade-off between a miner's own connectivity and the connectivity between other miners.",

The core observation of the paper is the following: in order to maximize her rewards, a miner should ideally choose its network connections such that its own paths to other miners are of lower latency (on an average) as compared to the paths that exist between other miners. \n\nBased on this observation, the paper formulates the problem of miners deciding their connections to other miners for maximum marginal mining rewards as a combinatorial bandit problem. Concretely, the paper models (a simplified version of) the problem as a Markov decision process with no state and a combinatorial action set, and derives an optimal neighbor selection policy based on solutions to the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The key contribution of the paper is that it shows that, despite not having global knowledge of the network initially, a mining agent can learn information about the network given access to observed reward information.\n\nThe paper builds a simulator to validate the approach using a simplified, heuristically chosen reward function that works well in practice.\n\nI enjoyed reading the paper a lot.

I would also liked some additional discussion on the rationale behind the network coordinate model, and why it is amenable to creating an approximate picture of the network based purely on past bandit action-award information. \n\nThe experimental section seems quite thorough and well-explained."

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study of the Poof-of-Stake (PoW) Ethereum consensus protocol, following the recent switch from Proof-of-Work (PoS) to Proof-of-Stake within Merge upgrade. The new protocol has resulted in reduced energy consumption and a shift in economic incentives, but it has also introduced new threat sources such as chain reorganizations and balancing attacks. Using a simple and flexible agent-based model, this study employs a time-continuous simulation algorithm to analyze the evolution of the blocktree and assess the impact of initial conditions on consensus quality. The model simulates validator node behavior and the information propagation throughout the peer-to-peer network of validators to analyze the resulting blockchain structure. Key variables in the model include the topology of the peer-to-peer network and average block and attestation latencies. Metrics to evaluate consensus quality are established, and means to observe the model's responsiveness to changes in parameters are provided. The simulations reveal a phase transition in which the system switches from a consensus state to a non-consensus state, with a theoretical justification presented for this observation.",

        "abstract": "Access control, both physical and virtual, has always been a crucial aspect in maintaining the security of corporate information systems. Recently, several solutions have been proposed to address physical and virtual access control, including the use of electronic badges that can be costly to produce and easily misplaced. Additionally, numerous, sometimes expensive, cloud-based solutions have also been adopted. However, these solutions are often provided by third-party organizations, which require entities to place trust in these providers, a risk that is unacceptable for industries such as the military and banking. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Blockchain-based solution to establish a scalable and secure system for managing access controls. Blockchain offers a secure, decentralized, and most importantly, immutable alternative that eliminates the need for trust in third-party providers. We have implemented, tested, and deployed our Blockchain-based access control architecture on the Avalanche official network. The results demonstrate that this solution offers strong security, flexibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, making it a promising approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet of Things (IoT). Our deployment on the Avalanche network confirms the feasibility and robustness of our approach in a real-world setting.",

Next, we focus on the problem of fluctuations in mining revenue and the mining gap -- i.e., a situation, in which the immediate reward from transaction fees does not cover miners' expenditures. To mitigate these issues, we propose a solution that splits transaction fees from a mined block into two parts - (1) an instant reward for the miner of a block and (2) a deposit sent to one or more fee-redistribution smart contracts (FRSC) that are part of the consensus protocol. At the same time, these redistribution smart contracts reward the miner of a block with a certain fraction of the accumulated funds of the incoming fees over a predefined time. This setting enables us to achieve several interesting properties that are beneficial for the incentive stability and security of the protocol. With our solution, the fraction of Default-Compliant miners who strictly do not execute undercutting attack is lowered from the state-of-the-art result of 66% to 30%.",

        "abstract": "Interesting blockchain properties have received considerable attention in research and practical applications. However, some properties, such as the transaction throughput, remained limited, especially in Proof-of-Work block-chains. Therefore, several promising directions, such as DAG-based protocols, emerged to respond to the throughput bottleneck. In this paper, we present a discrete-event simulator of DAG-based consensus protocols. Our simulator can simulate realistic blockchain networks created from data collected from a Bitcoin network, while its network configuration can be customized. The simulated network consists of honest and malicious miners. Malicious miners do not make any attack on consensus but they use a different than honest (i.e., random) transaction selection strategy to include transactions in the block to earn more profits than honest miners. This harms the performance of some DAG-based protocols, such as PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG, and thus decreases the overall throughput, which we demonstrate in our experiments and confirm the results of the related work achieved on a small network of 10 nodes. Next, we empirically compare different algorithms implementing the random transaction selection strategy from the mempool structure, and we propose a composite mempool structure that is memory-efficient and thus convenient for simulations of various transaction selection strategies over large-scale realistic networks.",

                "The authors propose an extension of a simulator for blockchain block production. The simulator is based on another one by Gavin Andreesen. The goal of the authors is to study miner profits and blockchain throughput. In particular the authors claim they will study the network behaviour in the PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG protocols.\n\nHowever, the paper has some weaknesses that prevent the reviewer to propose its acceptance. The most important weakness is the dissonance between what the authors claim and what they actually achieve. In fact, while the authors claim that they analyze DAG based blockchains (based on GHOST and PHANTOM) in the Contribution section, what they actually present is a simulation of the Bitcoin network. \n\nFurthermore, the authors make some assumptions of the Bitcoin network that collide with the system specification. For example: in accessing the mempool, the authors create three different approaches: Direct Access (i.e. getting transaction via an Id) , Random Access (i.e getting transaction randomly) and Sorted access (i.e. getting transaction in ascending/descending order sorted by the fees). The authors simulate honest-miners behaviour as \"random access\" to the mempool in multiple simulations, while the malicious miners are simulated as having a rational strategy for accessing the mempool (and creating blocks). In reality, it is well known that Bitcoin miners are incentivized to choose the highest-earning transactions, i.e. those carrying more fees.

        "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems can be used in the decentralized ecosystem to share data and assets. Polkadot blockchain is currently considered state-of-the-art for interoperability, i.e., communication between different networks. One of the key features of Polkadot is its ability to connect multiple independent blockchains, called \"parachains,\" into a single network enabling them to communicate with each other and the Polkadot relay chain. This paper describes an innovative approach to staking via a non-fungible token that behaves as an account (NFTAA). The key novelty of this article is using NFTAA to leverage the unique properties of NFTs to improve the security, transparency, and interoperability of blockchain networks.\nFurthermore, the account-based solution gives us the ability and flexibility to cover regular use cases such as nominative staking and liquid staking, but also effective composability with other Substrate pallets while reducing development costs. We have created two implementations: one for runtime pallets and one for smart contracts. We used Substrate Benchmarking Suite, which provides a set of standardized benchmarks and tools for measuring the performance of different aspects of a Runtime, including pallets. We have created a solution to set metadata and stake on the relay chain via the NFTAA. The pallet can also be used as an externally owned account, a smart contract, or a proxy account. This allows developers and researchers to choose the best solution for their needs. We tested the system and found that the pallet can meet our application's needs and provide high reliability and scalability.",

However, there are technical challenges that limit its widespread adoption. These challenges include the fact that different TEE vendors have incompatible solutions, and devices equipped with the same TEE technology may belong to different owners, making it difficult to establish trust between them. To address these challenges and fully utilize TEE technology, a decentralized coordination mechanism called DHTee is proposed. DHTee uses blockchain technology to support key TEE functions in a heterogeneous TEE environment, especially attestation service. Devices equipped with TEE can interact securely with the blockchain to determine whether potential collaborating devices meet the requirements.

        "abstract": "Manufacturing medical devices is a costly and complex operation. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) often outsources device manufacturing to their partnering Contract Manufacturer (CM) to lower costs. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) design control regulations are mandatory for getting the device to the market and require OEMs and CMs to collaborate closely. Often, the OEMs and CMs use software tools for requirements, design, and manufacturing that do not interoperate with each other. The lack of interoperability makes cross-organizational review processes, traceability, change management, and tamper-resistant documentation challenging. To our best knowledge, design control software vendors have yet to address these issues efficiently. This paper suggests a distributed FDA design controls framework using a private blockchain and distributed data storage to alleviate these problems. The framework provides an integration mechanism for existing software tools. Private blockchain provides privacy to sensitive and proprietary data and a tamper-resistant record management system significantly valued by auditors. We built a prototype to validate the architecture and its applicability using Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).",

For this reason collaboration among the OEM andsubcontractors is required to meet the required standards and auditable design histories.  Authors point out that nowadays collaboration is cumbersome (non-interoperable design software, data and formats, separate databases, etc. ), so to speed-up and secure the process, they propose to use a blockchain-based architecture that guarantees traceability through an auditable tamper-evident ledger.\n\nThe proposed architecture relies on Hyperledger Fabric as blockchain infrastructure layer, backed by an IPFS storage. Chain-code is developed to notarize throughout the design process the necessary information in the blockchain, while a service layer on top of the chain code allows authenticated users to access blockchain information (if they have the rights to do so). \n\nThe merit of the paper is to bring a real and representative use case demonstrating how to implement a blockchain-based application end-to-end. The different implementation steps are well-explained and design choices well-justified. On the other hand there is no clear scientific/technical challenge tackled in the paper. The use of a private blockchain coupled with IPFS is a quite understood engineering practice. Implementation is also limited to a prototype, so it is not obvious to conclude if the proposed architecture will scale as needed in real deployments. \n\nMinor comments:\nRelated work lists a set of works using blockchain-based traceability for different domains, however it is not clear if technical choices you made are similar to those made in these works (type of blockchain, security guarantees, confidentiality concerns, etc.).

        "abstract": "Ethereum is a decentralized technology that powers the cryptocurrency Ether and many other decentralized applications. It was launched in 2015 with a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, in which miners compete to solve mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In 2020, Ethereum began its transition to a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS). This mechanism relies on validator nodes, rather than miners, to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Validator nodes are chosen based on the number of Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum) they hold and are willing to stake or lock up as collateral. The transition to PoS was initiated with the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which coordinates the validator nodes' activities and manages the Ethereum blockchain's state. The transition to PoS is expected to provide several benefits, including increased scalability, reduced energy consumption, and improved security. This paper evaluates the transition from PoW to PoS by defining metrics that provide a basis for observing and analyzing these benefits.

                "In Section II A, the authors say, \" This algorithm is used by the two public blockchains with the highest market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\" This statement is not true anymore since Ethereum uses the PoS consensus algorithm since the last fork, this will need to be updated in the paper since it's a recent change.  \n\nFig 1 and 2 could use chronological step numbers since it's hard to understand the order of the steps involving the different entities. \n\nIn Section III, it is not clear whether the land registrar is independent per state or whether a central land registrar oversees all land registrars in the states. This would help understand the organizational differences between the different states and their requirements vs a centrally controlled process.\n\nMinor comment about Section III, the authors say \"If the value of the property does not exceed 6.010,12 euros: 24,04 euros.\"  This representation of currency is confusing, do they mean 6 thousand and 10 point 12 euros? If so then maybe 6,010.12 euros would be the internationally recognized format? This is confusing.\n\nIn Section IV, the explanation of stealth addresses is confusing with the use of actor, user, etc. It would be clearer for first-time readers if the authors used the sender/receiver or Alice/Bob terminology.\n\nIn Section IV, the protocol needs to be written in the form of an algorithm or protocol in steps. The sequence of steps explained in the right-side column of page 5 is confusing. For e.g., in one of the steps, the authors state, \"the lender gives the credit and updates the loan attribute, along with the lender agree attribute set to true to sign the contract;\" What part of this step interacted with the blockchain or the smart contract is not clear? Writing the interaction with the smart contract in the form of transactions submitted to the blockchain would make this clear.\nThe authors need to state who creates the smart contract. Is it the government since it plays the role of a trusted administrator? Will each state have its own smart contract?\n\nIn Section IV, step VI, the authors say \"if the credit has been paid off, the smart contract sends an event to the estate, to issue a certificate of ownership for such a property;\" Who is the actor \"estate\" in this context? Is it a government entity or representative on the blockchain? Is it another smart contract that automatically issues certificates based on requests from another smart contract?\n\nIn Section IV, step I, the authors say \" adding the price and the stealth addresses of the buyer, lender, and their own\" How does this work? The stealth address for lender, buyer and seller? Are the stealth addresses common between lender, buyer and seller? Or are there individual stealth addresses for the seller to buyer and seller to the lender? This is unclear.  \n \nIn Section IV, the steps do not cover the details involving the usage of stealth addresses and token ring signatures in sufficient detail, including the involvement of the users in these operations specific to the application. Parties interacting with the smart contract need to use transactions, this would be clear if the steps were written in the form of an algorithm or protocol with details about transaction contents and structures from each entity.\n\nSince the proposed solution has to be implemented in a permissioned setting, the process for signing up with the authority that runs the blockchain is not discussed. Is there any chance of a breach of privacy or information leakage? The proposed solution has no formal or comparative analysis of privacy and security guarantees. There is also no discussion about the scalability of storing all the data through smart contracts and if there is any information leakage if the same property is sold multiple times successively by the buyers in the previous stage.   \n\n\nSome writing/grammar errors are noted below, this is not an exhaustive list. The writing in the paper in general could be improved. \n\nGrammar error:\nSection I, please replace iiii) with iv)\nSection I, that arise with the use of such (a) platform\nSection II B,  blo-ckchain \u200b***should not be hyphenated***\nSection II B,  actors that administrates (administer/administrate) the blockchain\nSection III, similarly (similar) to India\nSection III, helps regulatory (body) by avoiding public",

Although the centralized finance and banking systems has served its purpose for so many years it has also been the target of attacks and while it may be have resisted some of them it has also fallen victim to a lot of intruders due to having a central point of failure. With banks and other financial organizations, a central authority has control over almost all the money of people and the question of trust and transparency arises. Leaving aside the aspect of hackers, it is without a doubt that the biggest threat to the global economy and the nightmare of many countries right now with the Covid pandemic is a financial crisis which is a decline in the values of assets for a financial institution. If the current centralized finance model is put under the microscope the list of flaws may continue. In this research, some of the major shortcomings of the existing financial systems will be highlighted and a solution using blockchain technology which is renowned for its transparency, immutability and security features will be proposed. These features can definitely prove to be beneficial in contributing towards a corruption and fraud-free system.",

                "This is not a scientific paper. It starts by criticising the bank system, in many cases with a completely wrong characterization of that system. Examples:\n1. the systems have been around \"for centuries\"; they run on computers which have been around for less than 100 years...\n2. \"attacks can be fatal\", but when did that last happen?\n3. \"if no backups are made\" - in most countries it is required by regulation or law that banks make backups and test them. \n4. \"Whenever a bank fails all of its transactions also fail and the money held by them is also lost\" - right, that's how it works.\n\nSection 2 is called \"Literature review\", but it is not that.\nSec 2A is like the introduction, off in many statements. It asks strange but questions, and ends with \"These ethical and philosophical questions could find their answer with a cryptocurrency called bitcoin and a decentralized technology\". Very funny.\nThe following subsections are supposed to introduce blockchain, but do a very poor job of it, e.g.: \"producing a chain of operations called the blockchain.\" It's a chain of blocks, it's literally in the name. Another example: \"A smart contract is an agreement between 2 parties...\" - nope.\nFig1: that may be an example use case of smart contracts, but it does not explain the principle.\n\nSection 3 presents the \"proposed solution\"... to an unknown problem, and without a proper discussion of the actual state of the art.\nSpecifically, it sounds like a collection of features that have been offered by commercial blockchain-based solutions years ago, including peer-to-peer lending and exchanges of various forms.\nTable 1 misrepresents Ethereum as PoW, which is outdated as of September 2022, well before the submission deadline.\n\nNext comes section 4, implementation - primarily a collection of screenshots.\nNo evaluation, no experiments, but conclusions follow.\n\nI have seen a lot of whitepapers that were more scientific that this submission.",

        "title": "Braess Paradox in Layer-2 Blockchain Payment Networks",
        "abstract": "Layer-2 is a popular approach to deal with the scalability limitation of blockchain networks. It allows users to execute transactions without committing them to the blockchain by relying on predefined payment channels. Users together with the payment channels form a graph, known as the offchain network topology. Transactions between pairs of users without a connecting channel are also supported through a path of multiple channels. Serving such transactions involves fees paid to intermediate users. In this paper we uncover the potential existence of the Braess paradox in payment networks: Sometimes establishing a new payment channel can increase the fees paid for serving some fixed transactions. We study conditions for the paradox to appear and provide indications for the appearance of the paradox based on real data of Bitcoin's Lightning, a popular layer-2 network. Last, we discuss methods to mitigate the paradox upon establishing a new payment channel.",

They have also shown that this paradox can appear when using different routing algorithms and depends on user demand. The authors have also proved that the Braess paradox cannot exist in a network with a Ring topology. The paper provides insights and indications for the Bitcoin network. However, further proof and formalization can be added to improve the rigor of the paper. Additionally, the study could be extended to other Layer-2 networks for comparison.",
